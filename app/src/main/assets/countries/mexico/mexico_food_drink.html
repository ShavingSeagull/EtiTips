                    Mexico is a country famed for its food. Whether you're in neighbouring America or across the pond in Europe, you won't have to look far to 
                    find a Mexican restaurant of some description. In the United States especially, tacos are a well-loved fast food thanks to restaurant chains 
                    like Taco Bell. The dish is, however, a native Mexican food and is loved by foreigners and locals alike. Paired with this are famous drinks such 
                    as tequila, which can pack quite the punch if you're not careful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Tacos (corn tortilla with various fillings) and Quesadillas (corn tortilla with cheese).

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: 10-15% of the bill</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mexico didn't used to have much of a tipping culture at all, but with famous tippers, America, to the north and Mexico becoming a favourite with 
                    tourists, it was only a matter of time before tipping became an everyday occurence. Serving staff don't earn a lot of money at all, making tipping 
                    a very welcome addition for people working in the industry. Tips will be welcomed in the biggest currencies, but do try to tip in the local Peso or 
                    the US Dollar if you can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For restaurants, it is best to aim for around 10% of the bill if you received good service. For exceptional service, 15% would be a lovely gesture. 
                    Note, the country doesn't typically indulge in service charges, but upscale restaurants almost always will. If you're eating somewhere fancy, check your 
                    bill for a service charge and gratuity before adding anything extra.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <u>A note about all-inclusive resorts:</u> Even though your food is included in the price of your stay, the tip is not. Most people won't think to tip 
                    waiters at an all-inclusive resort, but they will often bend over backwards to try and earn something extra. The tipping rate remains the same, just be sure 
                    that you remember to hand it to them when you're finished!

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: $1 or 10 Pesos for a couple of drinks</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in Mexico is expected in tourist areas, though you could get away with not doing it. Certainly, if you're drinking somewhere 
                    more rural, you won't be expected to leave anything at all. Take note, if you're receiving table service then a service charge with gratuity will often be added 
                    to the bill automatically, meaning you shouldn't leave anything extra; always check your bill. For a standard bar, $1 or around 10 Pesos will suffice for every 
                    few drinks you buy.

                    <strong>- Generally acceptable rate: 10% of the bill if you received table service</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in cafés or coffee shops only really applies if you were served at your table. If you weren't, then obviously don't leave anything for the 
                    staff. However, if you received table service, leaving around 10% of the bill will definitely suffice. You could also make use of the tip jar on the counter 
                    if the establishment has one.

                    When toasting in Mexico, the word to use is "Salud!" (pronounced sa-loo). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                <p>
                    It is typical in Mexico that the person who invited the other will pay the entire bill. However, it is polite to offer to pay, even if you are the guest; 
                    just know that it will be declined, so don't insist as this would be rude. This will be especially true for a man inviting a woman, whether platonically or romantically. 
                    As we mentioned on the Social tab, chivalry is very much alive and well in Mexico, so be prepared to release the moths from your wallet if you want to invite a lady to dinner!

                    Perhaps unsurprisingly for a nation famed for its cuisine, there is a general standard expected at the dinner table. General household standards may have eased 
                    a bit over time, though the following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Mexico, either in their homes or in public 
                    establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>You <b>have</b> to ask for your bill in a restaurant as a waiter bringing it to you without being asked is the height of rudeness</li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, wait for the most important person to start eating before you do. This will either be the host or the oldest person at the table</li>
                    <li>The host will sit at the head of the table, with their spouse on the opposite end. The most honoured guest will sit to the right of the host</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands on/above the table at all times, not just when eating. No elbows, though!</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Use your cutlery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>Be prepared to take your time! Eating in Mexico, especially at lunch time, is almost ceremonial and nobody likes to rush the experience</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is very good practice to bring a gift. Either chocolates, wine or flowers work well. It is also good form to bring a small gift 
                        for any children the host may have
                    </li>
                    <li>If you're invited for dinner at somebody's home, arrive around 30 minutes late. Your host will be banking on it</li>
                    <li>Note that women shouldn't give toasts in Mexico. This includes foreign women</li>
                    <li>Drinking to excess is extremely frowned upon, especially for women, though it is true for everyone</li>
                    <li><b>Don't</b> drink water from a tap! Consume only bottled water if you want to avoid stomach problems</li>
                </ul>

					<li>Leave a tip at any venue offering table service</li>
