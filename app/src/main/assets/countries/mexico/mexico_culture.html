                    Mexican culture is dominated by food, drink, socialising and festivals. While not a nation blessed with illustrious wealth, Mexico 
                    does place huge importance in the wealth of family, friendship and companionship. A slower pace of life, a warm climate and a warm people 
                    to match, there is a clear reason why Mexico has become a favourite for tourists the world over.

                    The official language is Spanish and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Mexico is hugely majority Christian, with a massive 93% of the population identifying with the faith, 83% of which follows the Roman Catholicism 
                    branch (as of the 2010 census). The second highest affiliation is non-religious, coming in at only 5% of the populace, showing that, unlike much 
                    of the rest of the western world, the younger generations are not moving away from religious affiliations.

                    Many Mexicans, as with quite a few other things, can prove to be very passionate about their religion, so it would be wise to keep an err 
                    of decorum should you find yourself discussing the subject. It would be ill advised to chastise Christianity in front of the locals, as doing 
                    so will likely make you appear a 'pig-headed foreigner', so to speak. Discussing religion is a sensitive area in most places, but in countries 
                    like Mexico, it's probably best just avoided altogether, though the locals do enjoy bringing the subject up from time to time.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    Mexicans favour a surprising degree of order to their dress sense. They generally side with dressing well whatever the occasion (so leave your 
                    sweatpants at home!), but certain things should be worn in certain situations. A great example of this is swimwear/beachwear, which should only be 
                    worn at the beach. It may sound obvious to keep swimwear on the beach, but we tend to let go of our sensibilities a bit when we go on holiday, especially 
                    to very warm countries like Mexico. Nevertheless, dress well, dress sensibly and dress for the occasion!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heed this warning about dressing in churches: Mexico has a beautiful variety of churches that are popular with tourists, but they are still 
                    places of worship and therefore a certain standard of dress is expected if you want to be let through the door. For the ladies, the shoulders (and cleavage, if any) 
                    should be covered (a light scarf will do) and for the gents, no bare chests and switch from shorts to any form of trouser if you can. Jeans, linen trousers 
                    and slacks are all fine. Sandals are acceptable for men and women, too.

                <p>
                    When the concept of time keeping was invented, Mexico obviously didn't get the memo. Whether you're meeting friends or going to somebody's house for dinner, it is quite 
                    essential that you turn up very fashionably late. For dinner dates, leave <i>at least</i> 30 minutes after the specified time. It can actually be rude to turn up at the time 
                    given because your host definitely won't be ready, which means you'll be inconveniencing them. If you're meeting someone for something, don't be surprised (or complain) if they 
                    arrive an hour late. Indeed, the pace of life is definitely a lot slower here, so it's best to put the idea of sticking to sharp schedules aside, whether 
                    you are moving to Mexico or just here on holiday. Take your time and enjoy what the country has to offer - the locals certainly will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Family is a hugely important concept in Mexican culture. Families here tend to be large and they tend to be close, so this is certainly something to 
                    bear in mind if you are dating/marrying a local, for example. The saying of 'marrying into the family' exists everywhere, but nowhere is it more 
                    applicable than in Mexico. Boys will be close to their mothers and elders will be held in high esteem. As we mentioned on the Social tab, the locals like 
                    to talk to foreigners, but don't take offence if the person you are talking to expresses concern because you happen to be 30 and not married/don't have children. 
                    In Mexico, this would be virtually unheard of, so their concern stems from a place of embracing a loving family rather than just being rude or nosey. Simply laugh 
                    it off and say it is in your plans to do so.

                <p>
                    Mexican businesses operate according to a traditional hierarchical structure, with a precedence put on status and rank. This also applies to meetings with Mexican companies, 
                    so it is important to send a representative who reflects the importance of the meeting. Sending somebody under-ranked would be an insult to your Mexican counterpart. As with 
                    everyday life, don't be surprised if your cohort turns up 30 minutes late to a meeting. That being said, the locals do expect punctuality from foreigners, so it will likely 
                    be the case that you will have to arrive on time and simply wait. We recommend the local coffee.
                </p>

                    A foreigner in Mexico for business? Then you should be aware that Mexicans don't like to do business with those they are unfamiliar with. Don't be surprised if a negotiation takes 
                    several meetings simply because they spent the first two getting to know you. In that vein, you shouldn't talk turkey until they do, as this would be rude. We appreciate that it 
                    can get a little frustrating if you're from a direct, no-nonsense country, to deal with people who need constant prodding to get things moving in meetings. Know though, that this 
                    is somewhat a test, so to speak. Mexicans like to take their time over everything, but if you get frustrated and give up early, they will assume you were never that serious to begin 
                    with. Business etiquette can be murky waters for companies from differing countries, so do take heed of the advice given here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A quick note about language: unless you happen to speak Spanish, it would be very wise to hire an interpreter for your meeting (a native who knows the local dialect would be better than 
                    a standard Spanish speaker). While there is a chance your Mexican counterpart will speak English, it is likely to be a little too lacking to conduct business. Take the initiative and setup 
                    a translator to ensure things go smoothly.
