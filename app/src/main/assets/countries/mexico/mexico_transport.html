                    Mexico boasts a surprisingly wide public transport network. Complete with multiple forms of buses, rail and even a reliable metro system 
                    in Mexico City, you will often find a method of travel that will prevent the urge to jump in a taxi. Note, that in places like Mexico City, 
                    the transport networks obviously get very crowded and have seen better days. Don't be put-off by this, however, as public transport in Mexico 
                    is some of the cheapest you will ever come across.

                    Though tipping has become commonplace in Mexico these days, this doesn't really apply to taxis. You are free to offer a small amount 
                    (such as rounding up the bill) if your driver has helped with luggage etc, but typically you can safely forego tipping altogether. This is, 
                    of course, entirely down to your discretion.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Like the rest of the country, people are generally well behaved on public transport in Mexico. Taking phone
                    calls is permitted on transport, but it is best to keep your voice down as much as you can. Contrary to expectation 
                    for such a hot country, not all buses have air conditioning in Mexico and in the summer during 
                    busy periods, it can get very uncomfortable. Think of your fellow passengers and make sure you wear deodorant...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, especially on city buses or the metro, as seating 
                    will be at a premium dueing busy periods. Do the right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. You are representing your 
                    country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will leave a positive impression on the locals. As we mentioned 
                    on the Social tab, Mexicans like foreigners, but only those who show a bit of culture and refined behaviour...

					<li>Make use of the metro in Mexico City. It has more than enough stops to take you where you need to go</li>
