                    Sadly, there seems to be two sides to the Mexican coin. For many foreigners, the word 'Mexico' produces images of violent drug cartels and a lawless 
                    society. While the cartels do exist (and honestly, where don't they?), they don't shape general Mexican life in the slightest. Leave the doom-and-gloom 
                    news stories behind because Mexico is a bright, vibrant country with a wonderful native population, great food, great drink and a welcoming culture.

                <p>
                    Greetings are an important social custom in Mexico. Whether meeting someone for the first time or the hundreth, you are expected to greet them 
                    when you meet and give a farewell when you part ways. Typically, this will be by using <i>Buenos Dias/Buenas Tardes/Buenas Noches</i> (good morning/
                    good afternoon/good evening), with a simple <i>Adiós</i> (goodbye) as a farewell. Note, too, that when greeting someone, a handshake or an air kiss 
                    is expected - a firm handshake for men (or a hug for friends) and an air kiss on both cheeks for two women. Kisses also apply to a man and a woman, but only 
                    if they're friends; if the lady is a new acquaintance, a short bow is expected instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Mexican people are extremely laid back and easy going. Their attitude is definitely one to adopt when you're in the country, especially if you're looking 
                    to relax! Mexicans also tend to be very polite, hence the importance of greetings. Always remember to say please (<i>Por Favor</i>) and thank you (<i>Gracias</i>) 
                    when dealing with the locals and, even better, do so in Spanish. Seriously, the locals place a lot of appreciation in foreigners who try to use even a totally 
                    elementary degree of Spanish. Mexcians are foreigner-friendly, but they do make a differentiation between 'barbaric' uncultured foreigners and educated, cultured ones. 
                    Always try to come across as the latter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of 'personal space' doesn't exist much in Mexico. It is very commonplace and an accepted practice to include physicality during conversation - 
                    think pats on the shoulder or touches of the arm etc. For some, this is as natural as breathing, but for others it can cause a simulation of a cat jumping 
                    out of its skin. Cultures tend to vary heavily in their social practices, but at least you can consider yourself warned if you are from a culture that 
                    doesn't practice much physicality in their social engagements. Following this is that the physicality tends to be elongated - meaning a hand shake or a squeeze of 
                    the arm could last several seconds. Again, be prepared for this, but don't flinch as this is seen as rude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Regarding conversation: most Mexicans will relish the chance to practice their English with you, so don't be surprised if you have a conversation struck-up with you 
                    every so often. Note, though, that the way in which the locals speak is different to what most people are used to in the western world. A lot of countries speak with 
                    a very direct manner, but this will be viewed as pushy in Mexico. Instead, match the laid back nature of the locals and don't be afraid to ask (or be shocked if asked) about 
                    somebody's family of their general health. This isn't nosey in the slightest and stems from the Mexican people's love for socialisation. Good topics for conversation with a 
                    local would be their family, their culture, their country or your own.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, a word on English speaking: in cities, you should fare rather well, as is the case with most places in the western world. As is also usually the case, the level 
                    of English speakers drops the more into the countryside you travel. Even in cities, don't be alarmed if the passerby you stopped for directions doesn't 
                    understand you. In such cases, it would be best to ask at a hotel or restaurant, or approach someone under the age of 30 - the youth are embracing speaking 
                    English as a second language much more than the generations before them. As we said before, the importance of making even the slightest effort with speaking 
                    Spanish is virtually priceless here.

                    Romance in Mexico is a mix of American influenced dating (in the big cities) and traditional courtship everywhere else. One thing to note, however, is that chivalry is 
                    still very much alive in Mexico and men are expected to perform the niceties for women that once existed everywhere. Whether that be opening a door, pulling out a chair 
                    or offering your jacket in cooler weather, a man will be expected to be a man and Mexican women will respond in kind, utilising their femininity to display their 
                    attractiveness. If you're someone of a younger generation reading this, just ask your grandparents how they dated when they were young and you'll learn everything you 
                    need to know to pursue romantic relations in Mexico.

                <p>
                    If you do manage to hit it off, know that relationships in Mexico can function a little differently than other places. Both men and women like to be in 
                    contact with their significant other quite a lot and can come across as intense or 'clingy', depending on what you are used to. This stems from a romantic culture 
                    steeped in tradition and passion, rather than a concept of smothering or control. Families will also play a huge role in the relationship, so do be prepared for this!
