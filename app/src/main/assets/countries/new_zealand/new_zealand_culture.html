                    New Zealand has similarities to its neighbour Australia in the sense that it has been born of multiple different cultures from the result 
                    of migration from Europe over the last couple of hundred years, while also holding onto its older Maori origins. Having close ties to 
                    the United Kingdom that persist to this day in the form of cultural similarities, New Zealand has become a land known for its laid-back 
                    attitude and easy-going people.

                    The official languages are English and Maori &amp; the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Though Christianity is the largest religion at 49% of the population (as of the 2013 census), the state doesn't ally itself to any particular 
                    faith officially. The Christians in the country comprise large swathes of Catholics and Protestants alike, which is in contrast to 
                    most countries in Europe, where the majority of the populace overwhelmingly follow a particular branch of the faith. The irreligious 
                    total 42%, making them the second largest group in the country and also showing the overly secular attitude the nation has developed these days.

                    To conduct yourself well in Kiwi society, it would be a good idea to keep strong beliefs to yourself. As mentioned, the locals 
                    are very easy-going and won't appreicate being preached to, regardless of the faith in question. Kiwis are very welcoming and hospitable, 
                    so you would be very unlikely to meet any resistance over following a particular faith or even just having one in the first place. Just be 
                    aware that they also love a good debate on occasion; it would be smart not to initiate it yourself, however.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    The general dress sense in New Zealand is on the casual side. It should be noted that this doesn't necessarily indicate lower standards; 
                    rather, Kiwis prefer to be comfortable, but keep a certain degree of neatness to their dress sense. There is also no religious reason to 
                    dress a certain way here. That said, you should be sure to dress appropriately if eating in restaurants etc. Having the sense to dress for 
                    the occasion is really all you need to keep in mind!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business dress remains traditional for the most part, with dark suits for men and a similar smart dress sense for the ladies. It does depend 
                    on the industry, however - some will favour a more casual approach where others opt for smart business dress.

                <h3 class="section-header">Everyday Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Kiwi everyday life is similar to many other developed Western nations, with hard work during the week and hard play at the weekend 
                    being the focus of many locals. People like to make an effort socially here, which can be in contrast to a few other nations in 
                    Europe that the Kiwis draw their heritage from. Sport also proves popular in New Zealand, with the international rugby team - the All Blacks - 
                    noted to be the best in the World. The team's traditional Maori Haka dance at the beginning of the match is instantly recognisable and 
                    globally famous, not just to rugby fans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is rather easy to advise matters of etiquette in New Zealand because the overall nature is very laid-back. Truly, it is fairly 
                    difficult to make a glaring mistake here. Kiwis like to be social and they like to get together for a beer and/or a barbecue. 
                    It is also extremely likely that you'll run into a local at some point who invites you for one or the other. Knowing someone for 
                    five minutes here is like knowing them for a lifetime and if/when such an event occurs, you should absolutely take them up on the 
                    offer. It can be a very alien concept to people from a lot of countries to be invited to functions by people they've just met, but 
                    there is no need to treat it with suspicion and it's a great way to meet some locals and have a bit of a cultural exchange!

                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    The Kiwi workplace is fairly traditionally hierarchical in structure, though there is a degree of egalitarianism in place that means 
                    employees of all levels can give their two cents on a topic and not be shunned for it. As with everyday life, formalities tend to be 
                    dispensed with rather quickly, though always take your cue from the locals around you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conducting business in New Zealand is noted to be a pleasant experience for foreigners, especially those from the West, as the country tends to follow 
                    the British approach of professionalism, while also keeping the typical Pacific warmth of the local people. This generally results in a straightforward 
                    professional business negotiation, minus some of the cold corporate attitude that can sometimes occur elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with everyday life, it is difficult to make an overly glaring error when dealing with Kiwi businesses, providing you employ some good manners and 
                    common sense. Firstly, make sure you schedule meetings in advance and be sure to arrive to them on time. Lateness (without valid reason) will likely 
                    give the impression of indifference or even flat-out rudeness. Certainly not a look you want to give right off the bat. Secondly are negotiation tactics. 
                    If your usual approach is the famed 'hard-sell', drop it and fast. Kiwi associates will not appreciate trying to be strong-armed into accepting terms of 
                    a deal and negotiations will likely break down altogether. In the same vein, the locals also aren't much for haggling. While the typical rule-of-thumb is to 
                    start high and work down to an acceptable level in negotiations, it is a better idea to kick things off around the price you'd like to achieve. Not to say you 
                    can't start a little above your acceptable line and work down, just keep the initial proposals sensible and close to what you're looking to achieve.
