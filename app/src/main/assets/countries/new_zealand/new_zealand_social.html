                    A close neighbour of Australia, but differing in many ways, New Zealand is a country famed for its beautiful landscapes, friendly people 
                    and a decided lack of lethal creatures compared to its Outback cousin across the sea. So impressive is the natural scenery, that a number 
                    of very high profile movies have been filmed in New Zealand, the most famous being the Lord of the Rings & Hobbit trilogies.

                    New Zealanders or 'Kiwis', as they're usually known, are very hospitable, which stems from some of the mix of European cultures that 
                    contribute to the ethnic makeup of the people, but also the Maori culture, which is steeped in hospitality, even to the point of going 
                    without for themselves. The local people tend to be very easy-going and friendly, willing to open their homes to a new friend they 
                    have just made or help out a stranger in need. It is partially for this reason that the country remains so popular for people looking to travel the 
                    World, as well as those looking for a new start, though the higher salaries in Australia tend to draw more people there for the latter reason.

                    The face has the ability to set a powerful first impression, so learn how to use yours! Smiling is an often used tool to portray friendliness in 
                    New Zealand, with many passersby on the street smiling at each other. This is especially true if you see somebody you are at least somewhat 
                    acquainted with, as smiling is taken to mean that you're happy to see somebody. So, don't be afraid to flash the pearly whites and likewise, don't 
                    feel awkward if a stranger smiles at you as they pass you by on the street, especially in more rural areas - just reciprocate!

                    Kiwis love a good chat and are generally very social, though there a few loose rules to this. Typically, the rule of thumb is not to make things too 
                    personal too quickly. Asking about a person's job or how their children are doing is OK, but discussing things like salary or their health would 
                    make you appear rude and nosey. Save the more personal subjects for people you know very well. Aside from that loose custom, socialising in New Zealand 
                    is typically an easy endeavour, as the people are easy-going and like to avoid drama. In that vein, greetings are also laid-back, with a simple handshake 
                    sufficing (Maoris will usually kiss on the cheek) and don't be too concerned about formality - Kiwis like to dispense with it as quickly as possible. It's 
                    always best to start off using a person's title and surname, but be prepared to move onto a first name basis quickly - simply take the cue from your local 
                    counterpart, who will either tell you directly to drop the formality or will just start calling you by your first name.

                    Romance etiquette in New Zealand is as laid-back as the people. Public displays of affection should be kept respectful, as most people 
                    don't want to observe borderline cannibalism, though don't have to be avoided altogether; moderation is definitely key. Aside from that, 
                    the only thing noteworthy to point out is that the dating culture tends to err on the side of promiscuity. Whether this is a positive or a negative is 
                    for the individual to decide, but it's worth knowing if you are considering starting a new life here, for example. Same-sex marriage has also been legal since 
                    2013, so please bear this in mind if your personal beliefs differ from the population at large. Naturally, there will be areas that are more accepting than 
                    others, but same-sex couple need not fear coming to New Zealand for any reason.

                        Be abashed by hearing a certain unpleasant four letter word beginning with 'C' and ending in 't'. Kiwi 
                        friends tend to use it with each other as a stand-in for 'mate' or 'buddy' on more than one occasion. Yes, 
                        it also retains its usual meaning and use, too, in case you were wondering. Context is definitely key
