                    New Zealand boasts a good public transport network, with train, bus, ferry and domestic flights being options, as well as the usual taxis. 
                    Owing to the nation's low population density, using a car is advised, especially if travelling to rural areas as there will 
                    often be no other option to get around.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping taxis follows suit with much of the rest of New Zealand in that it isn't really expected. Taxi drivers tend to earn 
                    fairly well, making tipping redundant. You will sometimes hear people say "Keep the change", but this is out of a desire not 
                    to carry around pockets of coins as opposed to wanting to leave a tip for the service. Feel free to follow suit or just don't 
                    leave anything extra at all.

				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour are fairly good on Kiwi transport. The services are safe and well maintained, so it would be best 
                    to ensure you help that trend along in your behaviour. If you happened to encounter any issues while travelling, you'd likely 
                    find one or several locals stepping in to help anyway (though don't take that for granted, naturally). You also shouldn't be 
                    surprised if nearby passengers strike up a conversation, as the locals like to be sociable. Don't shy away from this, as it can be a great 
                    way to get to know the local people and the area in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to somebody vulnerable, such as someone elderly or disabled. Good manners will be appreciated here 
                    and you are representing your country when you go abroad, so it is always a good idea to leave as good an impression as you can. 
                    Just think of it this way - would you appreciate someone at home being kind enough to offer their seat to your elderly grandmother/mother?
