                    Not a nation overly famed for its cuisine, New Zealand does, however, host a diverse selection of other cultures' cuisine, 
                    as well as its tasty selection of Maori based recipes. It is common to find streets lined with Chinese, Indian, Italian, 
                    French, Spanish and Japanese restaurants, to name a few. If you have a taste for something, you'll likely find a place nearby.

                    Tipping in New Zealand is definitely a practice residing in murky waters. While tipping <i>does</i> exist here, it isn't overly commonplace 
                    among the locals, as the average wage for service workers in the country is high enough that tips aren't really 
                    required by the staff - typically you'll only see tipping in tourist areas. A lot of locals have the view that you shouldn't be giving money away 
                    freely to people who are earning a wage already just doing their job. While tipping outright isn't common here, a lot of establishments will 
                    have a tip or charity jar on the front counter, which you could leave your spare change in. A good way to get rid of any spare coins that can't be 
                    changed back to your native currency and you could even get to help a local charity in the process.

                    Tipping in pubs is even less common than in restaurants. You <i>may</i> see the odd tip jar here and there, but you're not under any expectation 
                    to use it whatsoever.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Cafés, like restaurants, don't really practice a tipping culture. As is always the case, in typically touristy areas you 
                    may find some folks leaving something, but it absolutely isn't necessary, so please don't feel the need to at all. Like 
                    bars and restaurants, you may see a tip jar on the front counter, which can be used to get rid of any loose change as a matter 
                    of convenience more than anything else.

                <p>
                    When toasting in New Zealand, the word to use is, of course, "Cheers!". If clinking glasses, some people will look at their
                    glass and others will look at the other person; it is merely personal preference.

                <p>
                    Splitting the bill is common and fairly straight forward in New Zealand. Typically, a group of people will simply pay for what they 
                    ordered, rather than one person paying the whole amount or splitting the bill evenly amongst everyone at the table. There's no stigma 
                    toward inviting somebody out for dinner and covering the bill yourself, so the whole concept of paying the bill ends up as easy-going 
                    as the people!

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. Also worth bearing in mind is that Maoris will have a few of their own customs at the dinner table, which we will 
                    distinguish below. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in New Zealand, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Keep your elbows off the table while eating</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>
                        Use your cutlery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not. 
                        The locals won't mind if you use your cutlery the American way, though
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be mindful of your language when eating in public venues. There are likely to be children around you</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, remember to thank them for the meal when you have finished. A common phrase to use is, 
                        "That was lovely, -insert name-, thank you"
                    </li>
                    <li>It is polite to bring a small gift if eating at somebody's home, even if they tell you not to bring anything</li>
                    <li>(Maori) Do not begin eating until a prayer has been said to bless the food. Much like the concept of saying Grace</li>
                    <li>(Maori) The Maoris like to sing folk songs and may ask you to sing a song of your country after dinner. It's best to have one or two prepared!</li>
                    <li>(Maori) Maoris are often hospitable to the point of going without for themselves. Be sure to thank them enthusiastically after the meal has ended</li>
                </ul>

                        Dress appropriately at restaurants. Most don't have a dress code and the general Kiwi dress sense is casual, but 
                        don't mistake this for a lack of standards
                    </li>
