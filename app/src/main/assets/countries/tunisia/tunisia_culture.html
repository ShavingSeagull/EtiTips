                    Tunisia's culture is shaped by its varied history and the differing ethnic groups that have called the country home over the years. A history of 
                    colonisation by France has led to the French language being present in the country in minority capacities, as well as European 
                    cultural influence being present even to this day. With rich history dating back to the Carthaginian civilisation and beyond, you definitely won't be short 
                    of things to see and experience in this ancient land.

                    The official language is Arabic (though the Tunisian dialect is most widely spoken) and the official religion is Islam.

                <p>
                    Tunisia is majority Muslim, with an overwhelming 98% of the population estimated to identify with the faith, the vast majority with the Sunni branch. 
                    The second highest affiliation is Christian, coming in at only 2% of the populace. Islam as a religion is usually entwined with state affairs, but 
                    in Tunisia this differs. The nation has taken a more secular approach, where religion and state are kept separate, other than the constitution stating the 
                    President must be a Muslim. This has led to a greater tolerance for religious freedom and a shunning of fundamentalism for the most part.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Islam does, however, have very strict rules that govern many aspects of daily life, whether the state is more secular or not. This can range from the place of 
                    women in society, to what is acceptable to speak about when discussing the religion itself. There has been a lot of tension between Muslims and non-Muslims in the 
                    last couple of decades, so it is best, if you are a Western tourist, to be extra vigilant in the way you behave while in Muslim countries. Don't be alarmed, however - 
                    Tunisians are friendly and warm people who will be accommodating regardless of where you're from. That said, it would be extremely wise not to engage in discussion 
                    about religion, especially if you are non-religious; they are unlikely to ask about your personal beliefs, either. Under no circumstance should you talk about the Muslim 
                    prophet, Mohammed; it is just a subject best avoided altogether. In many countries, speaking ill of him will cost you your life.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    Tunisian dress is conservative, with little-to-no emphasis on bearing flesh. Though times are slowly changing in the big cities, it would still be very wise to follow suit 
                    and dress safely, especially if you are a woman. Bear in mind that Tunisia is a country in northern Africa, so the average temperature is rather high. Linen trousers and 
                    stylish shirts/light jackets will be a good choice here. Ladies are not required to wear a headscarf, though do keep in mind that displaying too much flesh will be very frowned upon. 
                    Covering the shoulders, chest and legs is a very good idea, whether a man or a woman. You wouldn't want to give the locals the wrong impression of you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are in Tunisia on business, be sure to dress conservatively and in dark colours, but smart. Ladies, be sure to wear a skirt that at least covers the knees and wear something on top 
                    that covers the arms. The locals place emphasis on snappy dressing as it conveys respect for those you are dealing with, so be sure to pack your best for a Tunisian meeting.

                <p>
                    Family is a hugely important concept in Tunisian culture. Families here tend to be large and they tend to be close, so this is certainly something to 
                    bear in mind if you are dating/marrying a local, for example. Children are important, as are elders, who are held in the highest esteem within Tunisian 
                    society and culture. If you spot an older person in need of help, you should definitely lend a hand as you will be setting an incredibly good impression 
                    with the locals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The pace of life is slower in Tunisia compared to the West. People take the time to socialise and see their families, rather than be bogged down with other 
                    things. If you are meeting a local friend, don't be surprised (or upset) if they arrive sufficiently late. It might be wise to leave a bit later yourself, too.

                <p>
                    A foreigner in Tunisia for business? Take note that business will not usually take place until your Tunisian counterpart decides they like you. The personal side of a working 
                    relationship is hugely important, so do take the time to get to know your cohort first. For many Westerners who are used to the opposite, the slower pace of proceedings that typically occurs 
                    may be a little frustrating, but do persevere as trying to conduct business in a Western fashion will prove futile. When it comes to negotiating, it is wise not to take a hard-sell approach, 
                    though do stay firm in your convictions as Tunisians tend to be hard bargainers; the more subtle approach will avoid your counterpart 'losing face' to their colleagues, which will be very appreciated. 
                    Take note that the language of business tends to be French. Business cards should have one side printed in French or Arabic and if you aren't a fluent French (or Arabic) speaker, look into hiring a local interpreter. 
                    Avoid scheduling meetings on a Friday, as this is the Muslim holy day. Also, avoid arranging anything during Ramadan, as businesses will be functioning on a reduced schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, Tunisian time keeping leaves something to be desired, so don't be surprised or angry if your associate arrives late, though you should be sure to arrive on time! If a business typically deals with foreign businesses, 
                    they do tend to try and arrive on time, however. Also, Tunisian meetings operate with an open door policy. This means that somebody could not only come into the room during a meeting, but they may even start a discussion 
                    about a totally different subject. You are free to join in with this discussion, but you shouldn't attempt to bring the conversation back to your negotiation - simply allow the new conversation to 
                    finish before getting back to business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...oh, and remember to use the right hand to shake hands! Right is king, left is unclean. A (sort of) rhyme to help you remember to act like a one-handed pirate while in Tunisia.
