                    Tunisia is a nation with huge historical importance, though most likely don't realise it. The famed Cathaginian civilisation, which proved to be 
                    a major thorn in the Roman Empire's side and one of its major adversaries, hailed from present day Tunisia. Indeed, the great city of Carthage, which you 
                    likely <i>will</i> have heard of at some point, was located on the eastern side of the Lake of Tunis. These days, Tunisia proves to be a popular tourist 
                    destination, as it has a rich history to indulge in and a culture to intice foreign travellers.

                <p>
                    Greetings are an important social custom in Tunisia. Whether meeting someone for the first time or the hundreth, you are expected to greet them 
                    when you meet and give a farewell when you part ways. When greeting someone, a handshake or a kiss on the cheek is expected, starting with the left - a 
                    handshake for men, kisses on the cheek for women and a handshake for men and women. Note, there are caveats to this that you must be aware of! It is common 
                    to see two men kissing on the cheeks when they meet here. Though homosexuality is strictly outlawed in Islam, Muslims also don't believe it really 
                    exists, thus physical affection between men is not out of the ordinary at all. When two men become friends, the handshake will likely evolve to cheek kisses. 
                    The greeting between men and women can also be murky waters. If the woman extends her hand, the man should shake it. However, if she does not, the man should 
                    give a polite bow instead. The woman must extend the hand for a handshake first!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tunisia is a Muslim country and so it is important to remember that a clear, strong distinction exists between men and women. Please don't be surprised if, as a woman 
                    with your husband, you ask a Tunisian man a question only to find he answers your husband and not you. This isn't as it may appear on the surface and is done to show 
                    respect to the husband rather than ignorance toward the wife. Likewise, a husband with a wife asking a Tunisian woman a question shouldn't be surprised to find she 
                    answers his wife and not him. It works both ways!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The speech style of Tunisians is direct, though non-confrontational. They would much rather agree with you than disagree, as to disagree would cause you to 'lose face', 
                    which is considered a rude practice to indulge in. It is unwise to speak ill or criticize a third party when speaking to someone in Tunisia as, again, it causes that third party 
                    to lose face. So, to summarise it, tact will be your friend here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may notice French being used here, which could seem strange for an Arab country. This is due to colonisation and it is considered a status symbol if a local can speak French alongside 
                    their native Arabic. Unfortunately for all you French speakers, while the language is present in the country, most people don't speak it well, so your impressive Français skills may have 
                    to wait for that trip to Paris instead. French does tend to be the language of business in Tunisia, though.

                    Romancing in Tunisia has strict rules. If you're here with your partner, you should absolutely refrain from public displays of affection. Tunisia is a conservative country 
                    due to its dominant religion and this must be respected when travelling here, as its rules are upheld with little leniency. Women in particular must be extra vigilant to 
                    behave with respect. Any form of public affection toward a man, even her own husband, will give the locals the impression that she is 'easy'. This is not a look you want to 
                    wear here. Ironically, even if the husband is the one to show affection to the woman, it will be her who is tarred with the 'easy' brush, not him. Not entirely fair, perhaps, 
                    but that's the way it is. Do take note, however, that foreign women can be friendly toward Tunisian men, just keep a very tight handle on it to avoid being seen as something you 
                    likely aren't.

                    An important note for same-sex couples: Tunisia is a Muslim country and Islam is most certainly <b>not</b> gay-friendly. When we say you should keep any and all forms of affection 
                    to the privacy of your hotel room, we don't mean you may get a few harsh words thrown at you as you may in your home country. To openly display homosexuality in any Muslim country, 
                    Tunisia included, is to risk your safety or, in some places, your life. This doesn't mean Tunisia should be avoided, but it does mean you will have to behave with the utmost decorum if 
                    you come here. Naturally, don't broach the subject with any locals, either.

                <h3 class="section-header">Useful Words</h3>
                <p>
                        Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting Tunisia. 
                        Learning a few could also help you make a good impression on the locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses (). Tunisia, 
                        like most other Arab countries, lists Arabic as its official language, but largely uses its own Arabic dialect in practice. We will 
                        list the local dialect versions here where possible. Note, all Arabic uses a gutteral sound similar to what you may find in Dutch, Welsh 
                        or Hebrew. When this sound is needed, we will write it as 'kh' - though note there is no hard 'K' sound to it.
