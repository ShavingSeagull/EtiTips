                    While not a nation traditionally famed for its cuisine, Tunisia actually packs a culinary arsenal that keeps foreign travellers coming back 
                    for more. Local dishes depend largely on lamb and seafood, though the vegetable based options are just as good, too. Famed north African dishes, 
                    like Tagine and Couscous, appear on Tunisian menus, though they differ from their counterparts elsewhere. Tunisian cooking uses lots of spices to 
                    liven things up.

                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Brik (pronounced 'Breek'. A pastry filled with various things such as egg and tuna) and Couscous.

                <p>
                    The tipping culture in Tunisia isn't as present as somewhere like Egypt, for example, though it does exist in the usual places for the most part. In 
                    restaurants, the usual rate is about 10% of the bill, though note that this should only be left if the service was good. Unlike places like America, 
                    where a tip is expected regardless of the quality of service, in Tunisia a tip is left to show appreciation for good service. Wait staff don't tend to 
                    make a lot of money, so they'll likely be very thankful for any tip you leave and if you're coming from a nation with a strong currency, tipping won't 
                    set you back much, either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note, some restaurants may employ a service charge. In such cases, a tip isn't necessary, so be sure to check your bill before you pay.

                <p>
                    Though Tunisia is a Muslim country, bars do actually exist, though they are required to be indoors with their windows blocked from the public being 
                    able to see in from the outside. Tipping in bars is similar to restaurants, with 10% of the bill being appropriate, though the world won't come to a 
                    grinding halt if you don't leave anything.

                </p>
                <p>
                    We would advise a rate of 10% of the bill for cafés, too. Though this should only apply if you received table service and the service itself was good, of course.

                <p>
                    When toasting in Tunisia, the word to use is "!صحة" (pronounced 'saha'). You can also use the French word "Santé!" (sahn-tay). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                <p>
                    Splitting the bill doesn't follow set rules in Tunisia. It is common to see people paying for what they ordered, though it really depends on the group who are eating. 
                    It is fairly common, too, to pay for the entire meal if you invite somebody to dinner who you don't see often or haven't seen for a while. Likewise, they will 
                    probably do the same for you, so don't be surprised to find yourself in a fight to pay the bill. It is better to relent and treat them next time.

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table. The following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Tunisia, either in 
                    their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to take your shoes off before entering</li>
                    <li>If you are invited to somebody's home for dinner, don't automatically assume your spouse is, too. Always ask</li>
                    <li>
                        Tunisians commonly share some of the food on their plate. There is a ceremony to this, however. They (or you) will offer, it will be refused a couple of times, then 
                        it will accepted after around the third insistence. Don't make the mistake of withdrawing the offer after hearing a refusal once or twice; also, don't make the mistake 
                        of failing to offer in the first place or genuinely refusing their offer!
                    </li>
                    <li>The right hand is king in Tunisia. You must eat your food with the right hand only. The left may be used for cutting something, for example, but use it sparingly</li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure to leave a little bit of food on your plate when you are finished, even if you're hungry! To clear your plate denotes that the host didn't feed you enough and 
                        will be taken very personally. Naturally, this doesn't apply in restaurants
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Following on from the point above, if second helpings are available, taking some would be a huge compliment to the host, as it shows their cooking is enjoyable. Just be sure 
                        to leave a little bit on the plate when you're done
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is very good practice to bring a gift. Either chocolates, sweets or pastries work well. Make sure you give the gift with the 
                        right hand, or both if it's heavy
                    </li>
                    <li>Be sure to compliment your host on their home, as this will be a great source of pride for the lady of the house</li>
                    <li>Don't expect easy access to alcohol as Tunisia is a Muslim country. If you are offered alcohol, be sure not to drink to excess!</li>
                    <li>Tunisians will generally forgive etiquette mistakes by foreigners, so don't panic about any dinner dates you may have!</li>
