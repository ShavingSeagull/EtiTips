                    Tunisia has a decent public transport system, focused largely on buses, trains and communal taxis. The rail system proves fairly reliable, though the service is sometimes 
                    prone to delays. Trains have first and second class carriages and if you're planning to travel long distance, we definitely recommend spending the extra for 
                    first class, as it is only slightly more expensive than second class, but the carriage is air conditioned, making a long journey much more enjoyable.

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: Round up the bill</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping taxi drivers doesn't need to be hard work. Generally, it is safe to just round up the bill, though naturally this is reserved for good service and whether or not he has 
                    tried to rip you off. Regional taxis are yellow; longer distance ones are white. They all have meters and, contrary to what a lot of drivers will try and tell you, the meter works, 
                    too. Don't get into a taxi that tries to set a fixed price with you before departing, as this will be higher and aimed at tourists who don't know 
                    any better. Always insist on using the meter and if they refuse, find another taxi. Ask a local for an idea of the journey price before getting in a taxi.

                    Tunisia has a few differing taxi services. One of those, which is unlike any other service, is the Louage. This is a people carrier that holds 6-9 people and operates 
                    along the most popular routes. What makes them unique is that they take a mix of passengers, but won't leave until all the seats are full. If you are in a hurry - or just 
                    desire more space around you - you can pay for multiple seats. Sometimes, if there are other passengers who are just waiting for the final one, they will agree to split the cost of the final 
                    seat among them. Louages are a very popular, inexpensive and great way to get around in Tunisia. Unlike Morocco's Grand Taxis, which are involved in road accidents due to overworked 
                    drivers driving all day and night etc, the Tunisian Louages don't tend to operate after 7pm, so take this into account when planning your journey.

                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! Louages are colour-coded depending on their purpose. A red stripe on the side signifies long distance, a blue stripe is regional and a yellow stripe signifies 
                    it's local/rural. The place to pick one up is at a bus station in most towns. You can check a price list (as they operate on fixed routes despite being taxis) or ask a local. Bear in mind 
                    that the drivers usually only speak Arabic and French. You may find some broken English in tourist areas, but plan your route and gather the necessary information beforehand. Asking locals 
                    works well, as Louages are a popular method of travel here and priced similarly to the buses.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    While Tunisians are generally friendly, don't expect much courtesy when using public transport. Buying tickets and embarking/disembarking can prove to be 
                    a bit of a free-for-all at times, so don't be afraid to stand up for yourself and get your place on the vehicle! Also, with people in close proximity on transport, 
                    be aware of pickpocketers. Tourists are always prime targets, so keep your belongings close to you and hidden, preferably under clothing. Keep any handbags/rucksacks 
                    in front of you and in your line of sight at all times.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, as seating will be at a premium, especially during busy hours. Do the 
                    right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. You are representing your country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will 
                    leave a positive impression on the locals, especially in a society that reveres its elders so much.
