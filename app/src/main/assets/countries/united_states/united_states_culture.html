                    The United States is a young country in retrospect, yet in a relatively short amount of time, it has become a huge influence
                    on the world, both from an economic/military and a cultural perspective. The US is quite famed for its patriotism, with the
                    national anthem being played before most sporting games and a lot of houses proudly flying the flag in the front yard. It may
                    call itself the 'Land of Opportunity', but if someone is going to succeed against all the odds, it will probably be in America.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The national language is English (with a large amount of Spanish speakers) and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    The United States holds its Christian beliefs rather dear. Even the national motto is 'In God We Trust', which also
                    features on the money. A massive 73% (as of 2017) of the population identifies as Christian, with irreligious folk
                    coming in second at 21%. This should definitely be kept in mind when travelling to the US. Not ones to chastise those
                    who hold different beliefs, most Americans will, however, take great offence to any belittling of Christianity.

                    To conduct yourself well in American society, it would be wise to be respectful toward to the local belief system, 
                    whether you belong to it or not. As mentioned on the Food &amp; Drink tab, a lot of American households will hold
                    grace (say a prayer) before eating a meal and it is in these such circumstances that a little understanding will
                    go a long way, if you don't usually carry out such practices yourself.

                    The general dress sense in the US is the same as anywhere else in the Western world: t-shirts, jeans, suits, shorts,
                    dresses, tanktops etc. There is no religious reason to cover oneself and no cultural stigma against wearing clothing
                    that leaves little to the imagination (in the appropriate setting, of course). The rule of thumb is that if you want 
                    to wear it, you can. That should make the choice of outfits to put in your suitcase a bit easier!
                </p>

                <p>
                    As mentioned on the Social tab, Americans tend to be rather chatty. Obviously, this won't apply to everyone you
                    meet, but that should be a given. On the whole though, don't be surprised to here "How are you?" or "How was your day?".
                    The perhaps not-so-obvious caveat here is that you shouldn't actually answer the question genuinely. When American 
                    acquaintances ask how you are, they rarely mean it; it is just a pleasantry, so a quick "Great, thanks!" will suffice, 
                    whether you are genuinely feeling great or whether your dog has just died. This also applies to the corporate world, but
                    more on that below.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The social attitude also applies to leisure time, too. Unlike certain countries in Europe, for example, Americans like
                    to spend their leisure time not just with their families, but also socialising with friends. Getting involved in a club, 
                    activity or hobby isn't unusual here and, likewise, in American universities, joining a club of some sort is also fairly
                    encouraged. While this won't affect you if you are just holidaying in the United States, if you are beginning a new life
                    here, it is definitely something to bear in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time is money! Seriously, the famous old saying really does apply here and not just in a business setting. Americans tend
                    to value their time and see it as a commodity, so be sure not to waste others', either by tardiness or flip-flopping on 
                    what to do etc. This goes hand-in-hand with the direct nature of the American people, so if you are invited to an event, 
                    be sure to give a definitive answer and if you plan on attending, make sure you do so on time!
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    American work life is noted to be rather informal and fairly casual, depending on the type of business, of course. The
                    typical work dress code is relaxed (again, with obvious caveats) and it isn't unusual to see some offices have pets! A 
                    lot of offices are open plan, which relates to the pro-social attitude and also the mantra of equality which is present 
                    in many American workplaces. It is quite common to see members of management and their teams engage and behave as one unit, 
                    rather than management lord it over their subordinates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mantra of 'time is money' mentioned in the last section is also true in work life. Americans like to arrive to work a little 
                    early and leave on time, rather than work late or over the weekend. The nature of some jobs might require this, of course (such as 
                    being on-call), but generally work and leisure have a defined line between them. So, if you find yourself Stateside on business, be 
                    sure to conduct what you need to during office hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The United States is famous or coining the phrase 'The customer is always right'. This certainly doesn't apply to a lot of other 
                    countries around the world and there are no doubt positives and negatives to both ways of thinking. That being said, if you are 
                    starting a new life here and you find yourself working with clients, be prepared for the company to take their side should any 
                    discrepancies arise. Likewise, if you are conducting business in the States and feel you are receiving poor service, don't be 
                    afraid to complain to management - they will likely be more than happy to rectify the situation.
                </p>

                        Ask or do something that encroaches on someone's privacy. While Americans are polite and 
                        outgoing, they don't like having their private lives invaded
