                    Perhaps most famous for introducing the noble hamburger to the world, American cuisine is known for its taste, its
                    questionable nutritional value and its size. Creator of fast food and the Greasy Joe, American food takes its inspiration
                    from the plethora of cultures that make up the United States. Whether it be Western European, Eastern European, African or
                    Oriental, your taste will be met here.

                <p>
                    Lets open with one thing - tipping exists virtually everywhere in America and it is taken very seriously. The general rule of thumb 
                    is that if you have received a service from someone who isn't behind a counter, you tip them. Seriously, it's <i>that</i> widespread. This may
                    be the Food &amp; Drink tab, but we're going to have to break with protocol in this app and list a host of other services here
                    before we get to the restaurants, bars and cafés below, as usual. Taxis will still be listed on the Mass Transit tab as usual, too.
                    So, without further ado, lets whizz through the services not mentioned in the other sections in record quick time:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Actually, quick bonus tip first! - as soon as you get off the plane or even before you leave your home country, make sure you exchange
                    lots of 'singles' ($1 bill notes). You are definitely going to need them for this vast tipping culture!
                </p>

                    <strong>- Generally acceptable rate (average grade establishment): 15-20% of bill</strong><br/><br/>
                    <strong>- Generally acceptable rate (upper class establishment): 25% of bill</strong><br/><br/>
                    <strong>- If a Maître ‘D seated you: $5-$10 for them separately, depending on the quality of the table</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, tipping is a serious business in America. Most wait staff earn the minimum wage, which isn't that high, but
                    it is actually legal for any industry that routinely experiences tipping to pay their staff less than half that amount - sometimes 
                    as low as $2.15 per hour. If you feel the tipping rates are too high in the United States and you want to forego the tip, just bear in 
                    mind that it isn't the establishment who is losing out, but the actual waiters themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that if you see a 'service charge' mentioned on your bill, that isn't actually a tip and won't go to the wait staff, so include a
                    tip as normal. Also, some establishments will include a tip automatically on the bill. This will be printed clearly, so be sure to read
                    the bill thoroughly first before handing over any money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not leaving a tip in a restaurant is virtually unheard of in America. Even if your service was poor, you'll be expected to leave at least
                    around 10%. There is a practice where you can leave two pennies (two 1c coins) as the tip, but only when you are deeply unhappy with your
                    service. Generally speaking, if you leave less than 15% of the bill, you should probably be planning on complaining to the manager, too.

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: $1 per drink</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bars aren't safe from the tipping system, either. If you are at a standard bar, you will be expected to tip the barman/barwoman around a 
                    Dollar per drink. This has its perks, though. Typically, you'll receive the fourth or fifth round free and if you tip a little more than
                    a Dollar, you'll often find your drink is a little stronger than usual, as way of thanks. Don't take those two hints as gospel, though; 
                    it is entirely down to the bartender's discretion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rules are a little different if you are being served at a table. In establishments that deliver table service, you should just add
                    10% to the final bill. Perhaps a little easier to remember than tipping for every drink, especially if you are from a country that doesn't
                    have a large tipping culture.

                    <strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cafés are murky waters for tipping. Most will have a tip jar on the counter, though there is no expectation to use it - at least
                    not like at a restaurant. If you're just getting a coffee, it is definitely safe to forego the tip. If you are ordering food at
                    your table, it would be wise to include a little something on the bill, just to be safe.

                    When toasting in the United States, the word to use is, of course, "Cheers!". If clinking glasses, it is a good idea to
                    maintain eye contact.

                <p>
                    If you are invited out for a meal, it is typically expected that the host will cover the bill. If couples dine together, it
                    can certainly be commonplace to split the bill, too. Usually, the bill will be split evenly between the number of people at
                    the table, although there can be obvious caveats to this, such as when one person orders soup while everyone else has
                    multiple courses. In such cases, the bill would be divided up as to who bought what. The same logic applies to alcohol
                    drinkers and non-alcohol drinkers, seeing as alcohol is much more expensive.

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in the United States, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Americans tend to eat rather quickly comapared to others, so if you are a slow eater, be prepared to speed up a bit</li>
                    <li>Hold the fork in your left hand and the knife in your right</li>
                    <li>
                        After you cut a piece of food, place the knife down by resting it on the edge of the plate and swap the fork into your right hand.
                        Eat the piece of food, switch the fork back to your left hand and pick up your knife again. This is in stark contrast to virtually
                        all countries in Europe, which keep the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right whether you're cutting food or not. Don't
                        worry, though - both ways of eating are accepted in America and using the European method won't draw stares
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you're eating the American way, when you put your knife down and switch the fork to your right hand, put your left hand in your lap.
                        <strong>Don't</strong> leave your hand on the table
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Don't speak while you're chewing food. Again, this is probably obvious to some, but it isn't a requirement to others</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be mindful of your language when eating in public venues. There are likely to be children around you</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it's a nice gesture to bring a gift. There aren't strict rules, however, so some flowers or a
                        bottle of wine will suffice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A lot of American households will say grace (a prayer) before starting the meal. If you're eating in somebody's home and they
                        hold grace, simply follow along with what the host does. Usually, this will involve closing your eyes while the host recites the prayer.
                        If you aren't religious, absolutely do <strong>not</strong> start eating while others are saying grace - be polite and follow along while
                        grace is held
                    </li>
