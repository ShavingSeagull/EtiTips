                    Totalling 50 states and 3.8 million square miles (9.8 million square kilometers), the United States is one
                    of the world's largest countries, as well as being the wealthiest and a global superpower. Relatively young
                    in age, the US has established itself on the world stage in a very short amount of time.

                    The stereotype of the loud, brash, arrogant American is alive and well for many people in Europe, who tend to be
                    rather reserved by comparison. This is, of course, not true of every American at all and it is as easy to find a
                    quiet reserved character as it is somebody more boistrous. That being said, social life in the United States is 
                    predicated on being outgoing and friendly. This can sometimes be seen as a surface-deep fa√ßade, especially in
                    areas like Los Angeles, where image is everything. For the most part, however, everyday folks tend to help each
                    other out and try their best to get along, especially in smaller towns and suburbs.

                    To be well received in American society, it is important to try and make an effort socially. Unlike in Europe, 
                    where small talk with strangers can be viewed with suspicion, in America it is quite commonplace. People tend to
                    make an effort socially here, so don't be afraid to speak up! This will usually be less true in big cities, but 
                    certainly in smaller towns, you are likely to be enagaged in conversation by friendly locals.

                    The United States is made up of people from vastly different cultures. Some of those cultures are passionate, some 
                    are reserved, so to give advice on things such as public displays of affection can be rather tricky! Generally speaking, 
                    it is better to err on the side of caution and keep those things to a minimum, though don't be surprised to see some locals
                    fly in the face of that rule!

                    Same sex relationships and marriages are legal in the US, but attitude toward such things is a mixed bag. Some states are
                    more accepting and in general this will apply to all metropolitan areas. The reverse is true in some states, however, so as
                    with public displays of affection mentioned above, it is just generally wiser to err on the side of caution. Typically, it
                    will be the smaller towns in more Southern states that will react negatively to same-sex relationships, so this could be
                    something to bear in mind when planning your itinerary. Folks in those areas are often some of the friendliest, too, though.

                        Be afraid to speak Spanish, if it's your native language. There are a large number of Latin people in America and it is
                        possible to find large areas that speak the language, especially in Florida and the Southern states.
