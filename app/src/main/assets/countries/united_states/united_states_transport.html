                    The US certainly isn't known for its public transport services, with it paling in comparison to most countries 
                    in Western Europe or others further East, such as Japan. That being said, while Americans highly favour using 
                    their cars, they do enjoy the best standard of air travel, which is often cheap and the far superior method of 
                    crossing the vast size of the country.

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: 10% of fare</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with virtually every other service in the United States, you are expected to tip your taxi driver at the end of 
                    the journey. Generally speaking, this will be around 10% of the total fare, but you can of course give a little more 
                    or a little less, depending on your service. If your driver has helped you with luggage on an airport run, it might 
                    be nice to give a little extra. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is a caveat here that might catch a lot of people out: you usually also tip for ride-sharing services, such as 
                    Lyft and Uber. It is safe to follow the taxi guideline and tip 10% of the fare, though again, this is entirely up to you. 
                    It is worth noting that these services are usually cashless, so giving the driver a tip in cash is acceptable and in some 
                    cases, the only method you have (as the fare will be prepaid via the app).

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour on American public transport systems are...not great. The subway system in New York City is famed 
                    for its poor standard of social grace among commuters, as are most bus services. 'Bus people' are often looked down on 
                    by the native populace, who much prefer the safety and privacy of their cars. Poor social etiquette aside, the public transport 
                    network, while lacking in most places that aren't big cities, is heavily relied upon by those who do live and work in said big cities. 
                    The horde of cars on the roads cause mass jams daily, with a 20 minute journey often taking hours during rush hour. So, while 
                    the public transport might be a bit of an unpleasant experience, it is usually worth undertaking to avoid the traffic!
				</p>
                <p>
                    As a quick aside, the aforementioned questionable social etiquette doesn't tend to apply to air travel, which is often much 
                    more pleasant. There will always be a bad egg spoling the experience for others, but on the whole, people are better behaved on 
                    planes than on subways.
