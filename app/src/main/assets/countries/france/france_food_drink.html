                    Probably the area of life France is most famed for, cuisine is everything to the French, although the local tastes certainly 
                    aren't for everyone. However, what does tend to be for most people is the excellent standard of French wine and, of course, 
                    champagne. So whether you're a lover of food or drink (or both!), you'll certainly find something to whet your appetite in 
                    France.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in French restaurants is an acceptable practice, but not actually essential and this is for two reasons. Firstly, waiters 
                    in France are paid an acceptable wage for the job they do - they don't rely on tips to make a living. Secondly, the tip and service 
                    charge are actually included in the bill by law. Yes, the tip in already in the price of your food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, it is just as common as not to see people round the bill up to the nearest Euro or leave a couple of extra Euros 
                    if the service was above and beyond. As in most countries, if you are eating at a higher class establishment, you will be expected to 
                    leave something for the waiter.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>

                <p>
                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in France isn't really expected. You can always round up the bill or leave a Euro or two if you wish, 
                    but it isn't an expected custom. If you are receiving table service, giving a little something would be a nice gesture. Not mandatory 
                    by any means, but a Euro or two wouldn't go amiss.

                    <strong>- Generally acceptable rate: Round up to the next Euro</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though the tipping culture in France is quite absent, it does actually exist in cafés. Whether just having a coffee or a small 
                    bite to eat, it is common practice to round up the bill to the next Euro. So, for a bill of €4.70, you would pay €5, leaving a tip of 30c. 
                    This may seem in stark contrast to some cultures, but owing to the reasons listed above in the restaurant section, tipping isn't 
                    hugely necessary for the staff here, though will never be turned down.

                    When toasting in France, the word to use is "Santé!" (pronounced sahn-tay). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass! 
                    It is also considered poor form to cross arms with anybody while toasting.

                <p>
                    It is most often the case in France that the person who invited the other will pay the entire bill. The French hate discussing money, so prefer to just take 
                    it in turns with their friends as to who pays this time around. Usually, the social group will keep a mental note of who paid for dinner last time and just 
                    go around the group, making sure everyone has paid for a trip to the restaurant in turn. That being said, you <i>will</i> see some French people splitting the bill, 
                    but it depends on the scenario - work colleagues or a large group of friends will often split the bill, for example. It is virtually unheard of for people to 
                    pay for exactly what they ordered, though; the bill will usually be split evenly and rounded up slightly to make life easier.

                    Important tip! - If you are a man inviting a French woman out to eat (whether romantically <b>or</b> platonically), you will absolutely be expected to pay! 
                    It is an old custom that still has a lot of life in France. Some women may insist on paying their share, but typically the man will pay for the woman.

                    Perhaps unsurprisingly for a nation famed for its cuisine, there is a general standard expected at the dinner table. General household standards may have eased 
                    a bit over time, though the following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in France, either in their homes or in public 
                    establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>After you take your seat, wait for the host to say "Bon appétit!" (enjoy your meal). It is rude to begin eating beforehand.</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands on/above the table at all times, not just when eating</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>Use your cultery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be prepared to take your time! Eating in France is almost ceremonial and nobody likes to rush the experience</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is rather essential to bring a gift. Either chocolates or flowers (not red roses) work well. 
                        However, under <b>no</b> circumstance should you <b>ever</b> bring a bottle of wine that isn't French. To say it is rude would 
                        be an understatement. The general rule is that if it isn't French, you shouldn't bring it
                    </li>
                    <li>Lay the knife and fork parallel to each other on the right-hand side of the plate when you are finished</li>
                    <li>Leave your bread by the side of your plate, never on top of it</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
			<div class="container">
				<h4 class="section-header">Do's</h4>
				<ul class="good-list">
					<li>Bring a gift when eating at somebody's home</li>
					<li>Mind your table manners. The French expect a certain standard and have little lenience for poor performance</li>

					<li>Bring a non-French wine to the host's home for dinner!</li>
