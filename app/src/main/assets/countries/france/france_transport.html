                    France has one of the best developed (and cheapest) public transport systems in Europe, boasting rail, tram, metro and 
                    bus. There are trains for rapid city travel and regional travel and trams which often avoid roads and even go 
                    underground. While not every city has the same setup, even the small towns have a bus system at the least.

                    Owing to France's excellent public transport network, taking a taxi isn't such a priority in cities like Paris as it can 
                    be in other countries. However, should you find yourself in need of a cab while in France, you should know that the typical 
                    tipping culture we have seen so far extends to taxis, too. Like bars and restaurants, it isn't essential that you leave a tip 
                    for your driver, but can be a nice gesture. That being said, quite a few taxi drivers in Paris are known for their lack of 
                    courtesy and in such cases it is absolutely acceptable to just pay the fare and leave. If you do wish to leave a tip, a couple 
                    of Euros will definitely suffice.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Like the rest of the country, people are generally well behaved on public transport in France. Taking phone
                    calls is permitted on transport, but it is best to keep your voice down as much as you can; this goes for normal
                    conversations, too. If you find people glaring at you, you have probably been too loud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, especially if they are women (and you are a man). 
                    Trains and the metro can get crowded during peak hours, so seating will be at a premium. Do the right thing and give a helping hand 
                    to those in need. You are representing your country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will leave a positive 
                    impression on the locals.
                </p>

                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! - Public transport tickets are rather cheap in France. Tickets can typically be bought in single fares or as 
                    booklets of ten. There are also day passes and youth passes available. Most commuters in Paris use the <i>carte orange</i>, which allows 
                    travel in and around the capital. A smart card service also operates, which allows faster commuting and unlimited travel within certain 
                    zones.
