                    French culture is dominated by art, music, cinema, food and love. When one thinks of a rich cultural European nation, France 
                    is one of the first places to come to mind for most people, along with perhaps Italy or Spain and that's for good reason: home 
                    to great artists such as Monet, Cézanne and Matisse, France has contributed so much to the world of painting, sculpture and art 
                    in general. The Louvre in Paris is perhaps the most famous museum in the world and is home to the world's most famous painting - 
                    the Mona Lisa.

                    The official language is French and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    France is majority Christian, with 51% of the population identifying with the faith (as of 2016). Interestingly, the 
                    second highest affiliation is non-religious, coming in at 40% of the populace, showing that, as with much of the rest of 
                    western Europe, the younger generations are moving away from religious affiliations.

                    The French passion for equality has led to other religions gaining tractions in the country and this is largely accepted 
                    by the populace. While religion remains a popular talking point for many people, it would be wise to keep the 
                    conversation respectable in France.

				<p>
                    Paris is usually regarded as the fashion capital of the world and for good reason - France is home to massive fashion 
                    houses, such as Christian Dior, Chanel and Louis Vuitton. Everyday dress sense in France is quite varied, but long dresses, 
                    tailored suits, scarves and, of course, berets, are popular. It would be sound advice to dress respectably and avoid garish bright colours 
                    if you want to blend in with the locals.

                <h3 class="section-header">Everyday Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité. The French national motto sums up the typical everyday culture quite well. Since the French Revolution of 1789-1799, 
                    the French have placed huge value in freedom and equality. Whether you're from a former colony, France itself or a naturalised citizen, in the 
                    eyes of the locals you are French, nothing more. This mantra of equality and freedom is also coupled with huge amounts of national pride and 
                    patriotism. If you want to make yourself unpopular in record-quick time, just disparage France to a local and you'll get your wish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    French everyday life is filled with cultural pursuits, romance, a fruitful social life and leisure time. Contrary to some of their neighbours, 
                    the French are rather social and enjoy the company of others, especially their fellow countrymen. The general attitude of the native people 
                    can sometimes be seen as arrogant by more conservative minded people, such as the British, who have shared a (mostly) friendly rivalry with 
                    the French for hundreds of years. This is a matter of personal opinion, however and shouldn't be taken as gospel for every French person.

                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    French work life is rather strict in the sense of working time and non-working time; France actually has a law in place to limit the working 
                    week to 35 hours. Like neighbouring Germany, the French place a very opaque line between work and play and under no circumstance should the 
                    two mix. If you have things to catch up on at work, it will wait until the next day. This also applies to the relationship with your colleagues - 
                    don't plan on even emailing a colleague outside of office hours or you could find yourself in hot water with HR. So, if you find yourself in France 
                    on business, do keep this in mind. You certainly shouldn't expect to be dealt with outside of working hours.
