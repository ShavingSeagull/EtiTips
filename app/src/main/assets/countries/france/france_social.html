                    France is one of the powerhouses of Europe, with a large economy and a rich history dating back over a thousand years. 
                    Known for their passion, cuisine, wine, romantic language and friendly rivalry with the British, French social life is 
                    dominated by leisure, love and culture. The south of France remains a popular retirement destination for older folks from 
                    all over Europe, who wish to escape the cold winters.

                    The capital city is Paris and the currency is the Euro (€).

                    The French tend to value formality in social situations, which can be in stark contrast to many societies today. Proper 
                    greetings and social cues will be expected, so it is important to have a good idea of the basics when travelling to France 
                    as a foreigner - the French don't tend to be overly forgiving when you make mistakes in their country. If you are a French 
                    speaker, it is important to use <i>vous</i> over <i>tu</i>; the difference being the first is formal and the second isn't. 
                    This applies more so in cities like Paris, but noticeably less so the further south in the country you go. Rural areas also 
                    tend to be less formal than cities.

                    Don't expect to be given an easy time as a native English speaker! Don't be fooled - a lot of French people speak some degree 
                    of English, but many will feign ignorance when they hear the language used. This tends to stem from a mixture of national pride 
                    and a general rivalry with the British. Trying to make an effort with the local dialect will definitely stand you in good stead, 
                    although people working in service industries, such as restaurants, will gladly speak English with no qualms. Don't be put-off, 
                    however - the younger generations are taking greater pride in being able to speak English as a second language, so the mantra of 
                    'French only' is weakening.

                    The French are famous for kissing each others' cheeks when greeting, but this isn't always the case. Typically, men will shake hands 
                    and women will kiss on the cheek. Men do kiss on the cheek, but usually if they are related or very familiar with one another. Small 
                    children usually expect a kiss on the cheek as well, so don't be surprised to see a lady or a child turn their face toward you when 
                    you meet them! This concept is quite alien to a lot of cultures, so if in doubt, do what the other person is doing: if they initiate 
                    a hug with a kiss on the cheek, simply follow along; if they extend their hand, well....I think you can work that one out for yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One final note: the French tend to stand quite close to the person they are speaking to and they don't raise their voices unless in an 
                    argument. Under no cicumstance should you shout across a room or down the street to somebody; it is most impolite. It may be a little 
                    unnatural to you depending on where you come from, but try not to edge backwards if you find a French person standing too close when they 
                    speak to you - they'll likely just move in again anyway.

                    Love and romance is bread and butter to French life, or so the stereotype will have you believe and, honestly, it's not entirely wrong. 
                    Where the stereotype does fly out the window, however, is with sex. A lot of folks have the image that French people, men or women, will 
                    jump into bed with anything that has a pulse and it simply isn't true; in fact, it's quite the opposite. The dating scene doesn't really 
                    exist in France like it does everywhere else. There is no concept of 'first base, second base' etc and both men and women enjoy the game 
                    of love far more than skipping to the end result.

                    The old notion of the French being flirty is very true, though. Harmless flirting is a part and parcel of everyday life and for this reason 
                    it can be hard for foreigners to distinguish if a French person is romantically interested in them or not. Rest assured, if you are seeking 
                    love in France, the other person will make it very clear if they like you beyond the usual cultural flirting, whether a man or woman. Touching 
                    isn't shied away from in France like it is in somewhere such as Germany, for example, so this can be a good cue as well.

                    Public displays of affection are very commonplace in a city like Paris. As with most things, the attitude becomes a bit more conservative in 
                    rural places, but it is certainly acceptable to maul your lover in the metropolitan areas. So, if you aren't used to such things - prepare yourself! 
                    And if you are - go to town!
