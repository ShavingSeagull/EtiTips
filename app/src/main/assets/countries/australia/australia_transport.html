                    Australia boasts a good public transport network, with train, bus, ferry and tram being options depending on the city 
                    you are in. The local transport is safe and reliable, with strict regulations and guards at every station and on every 
                    train. There are smart card options for convenient and cheaper travel in most major cities.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>

                <p>
                    Tipping taxis follows suit with much of the rest of Australia in that it isn't really expected. Taxi drivers tend to earn 
                    fairly well, making tipping redundant. You will sometimes hear people say "Keep the change", but this is out of a desire not 
                    to carry around pockets of coins as opposed to wanting to leave a tip for the service. Feel free to follow suit or just don't 
                    leave anything extra at all.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour are fairly good on Australian transport. The services are safe and well maintained, so it would be best 
                    to ensure you help that trend along in your behaviour. If you happened to encounter any issues while travelling, you'd likely 
                    find one or several locals stepping in to help anyway (though don't take that for granted, naturally). You should also expect 
                    nearby passengers to strike up a conversation, as the locals are very sociable. Don't shy away from this, as it can be a great 
                    way to get to know the local people and the area in general.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to somebody vulnerable, such as someone elderly or disabled. Good manners will be appreciated here 
                    and you are representing your country when you go abroad, so it is always a good idea to leave as good an impression as you can. 
                    Just think of it this way - would you appreciate someone at home being kind enough to offer their seat to your elderly grandmother/mother?

                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! - As mentioned above, the major cities employ a smart card system for travel on public transport. This proves to 
                    be more convenient and cheaper than traditional tickets. These pay-as-you-go cards can be purchased from any station, though each city 
                    uses their own version, so you can't use Sydney's card in Melbourne, for instance. Below is a reference of the cards used in each city:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list">
                    <li><b>Sydney</b> - Opal Card (trains, trams, buses and ferries)</li>
                    <li><b>Melbourne</b> - myki Card (trains, trams and buses)</li>
                    <li><b>Brisbane</b> - Go Card (trains, trams, buses and ferries)</li>
                    <li><b>Perth</b> - SmartRider (trains, buses and ferries)</li>
                    <li><b>Canberra</b> - MyWay (buses)</li>
                    <li><b>Adelaide</b> - Metrocard (trains, trams and buses)</li>
                    <li><b>Hobart</b> - Greencard (buses)</li>
                    <li><b>Darwin</b> - Tap &amp; Ride Card (buses)</li>
