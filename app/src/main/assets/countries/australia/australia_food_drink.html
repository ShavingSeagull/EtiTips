                    Not a nation overly famed for its cuisine, Australia does, however, host a diverse selection of other cultures' cuisine, 
                    as well as its world famous love of barbecueing anything. It is common to find streets lined with Chinese, Indian, Italian, 
                    French, Spanish and Japanese restaurants, to name a few. If you have a taste for something, you'll likely find a place nearby.

                    Tipping in Australia is definitely a practice residing in murky waters. While tipping <i>does</i> exist here, it isn't overly commonplace 
                    among the locals, as the average wage in the country is actually rather high, even by service industry standards, so tips aren't really 
                    required by the staff. A lot of locals have the view that you shouldn't be giving money away freely to people who are earning a wage already 
                    just doing their job. That said, when it comes to restaurants, you can leave a few dollars extra if you really wish, but is isn't required 
                    at all and certainly don't bother with working out a certain percentage of the bill. Do consider leaving a tip if eating in a high-end 
                    establishment, however.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some restaurants choose to add a service charge to your bill. Any and all charges need to be clearly stated on the bill by law, so do check 
                    it before leaving any tip, as you shouldn't really leave anything extra if a charge is present. You really will just be throwing money away.

                    Tipping in pubs in Australia is not expected at all. Some establishments will have a tip jar, but there is no expectation
                    to use it. However, a phrase you may hear when someone orders a drink is "and one for yourself". If someone wishes to show their
                    appreciation, that is usually the way they do it. The barman/woman will either pour themselves a drink there and then or
                    put the money aside to use later. This is most common with patrons who visit a regular establishment and know the bar staff well,
                    though it can be practiced by anyone.

                <p>
                    Cafés, like restaurants, don't really practice a tipping culture. As is always the case, in typically touristy areas you 
                    may find some folks leaving something, but it absolutely isn't necessary, so please don't feel the need to at all.

                <p>
                    When toasting in Australia, the word to use is, of course, "Cheers!". If clinking glasses, some people will look at their
                    glass and others will look at the other person; it is merely personal preference.

                <p>
                    Splitting the bill is commonplace in Australia in the sense that people will just split the bill evenly and pay the same share 
                    each. This is sometimes skewed more heavily toward the person with a higher salary, but only at the behest of the higher earning 
                    person, of course. Where you will run into problems is with the restaurants, who usually refuse to split bills. If you're paying 
                    in cash, lumping all the cash together equally will be fine, of course, but if you're all using cards to pay, don't be surprised 
                    to see the restaurant decline, especially for larger parties. Having someone with just a card paying the whole bill and reimbursing 
                    them immediately with cash would be one option around this.

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Australia, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Keep your elbows off the table while eating</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>Use your cutlery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be mindful of your language when eating in public venues. There are likely to be children around you</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, remember to thank them for the meal when you have finished. A common phrase to use is, 
                        "That was lovely, -insert name-, thank you"
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

				<h4 class="section-header">Do's</h4>
				<ul class="good-list">
					<li>
                        Be sure to dress appropriately for restaurants. The typical Aussie clothing style is rather relaxed, but don't mistake 
                        that for lack of standards
                    </li>
					<li>Thank your host for the meal if eating in somebody's home</li>
					<li>Mind your manners at the dinner table</li>
				</ul>

			<div class="container">
				<h4 class="section-header">Don'ts</h4>
				<ul class="bad-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
					<li>Tip in restaurants, pubs or cafés unless the service was super human</li>
					<li>Act ungraciously at the dinner table, whether in public or a private residence</li>
					<li>
                        Make a scene in a restaurant if there is a problem with your service. Simply have a quiet word with the manager and
                        you'll likely find the situation resolved immediately. They will appreciate you preserving the reputation and 
                        atmosphere of the establishment and in turn, be more likely to help you.
                    </li>
