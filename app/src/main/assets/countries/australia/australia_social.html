                    A relatively young country compared to most others, Australia has made its mark on the World in a quick amount of time and 
                    has since become a top destination for travellers and people looking to emigrate their home nations alike. Deceivingly large, 
                    being bigger than most maps give it credit for, Australia is vast and houses many differing biomes, such as tropical rainforests 
                    to the north and the famous desert outback further south.

                    If you look up the word 'hospitable' in the dictionary, it should direct you to the entry for Australia. The local people tend to 
                    be overwhemingly easy-going and friendly, willing to open their homes to a new friend they have known for literally five minutes. 
                    It is partially for this reason that the country remains so popular for people looking to travel the World, as well as those looking 
                    for a new start.

                    Aside from their hospitality, Australians generally tend to be rather loud and talkative, though naturally there are caveats to this. 
                    It should be noted, however (and apologies to any Australians reading this), that a number of local men in particular can tend to be 
                    rather arrogant and boistrous. This, of course, doesn't apply to all Australians and you'll find as many humble minded folks as you 
                    will the opposite, but the frequency of more arrogantly minded people should be noted, as you will almost certainly run into one or 
                    two during your travels here. The naturally confident, outgoing nature of the locals is likely the cause for this, so if it isn't 
                    your thing, just pick any new friends as carefully as you would back home!
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, the Aussies - as they're colloquially known - love a good chat, so don't be afraid to engage the locals over 
                    anything you fancy talking about. This will be especially easy over a beer or twelve (our recommendation is Castlemaine XXXX - and 
                    it's better warm than cold), so don't be surprised if you make a new best friend in the space of a few hours while you're both enjoying 
                    the fruits of the local brewery. If you aren't the chatty type, it would be best to try and make an effort, as not responding well 
                    when a local starts a friendly chat will be seen as a little rude.

                    Romance etiquette in Australia is as laid-back as the people. Public displays of affection should be kept respectful, as most people 
                    don't want to observe borderline cannibalism, though don't have to be avoided altogether; moderation is definitely key. Aside from that, 
                    there is little noteworthy to point out. Same-sex marriage has been legal since 2017, so please bear this in mind if your personal beliefs 
                    differ from the population at large. Naturally, there will be areas that are more accepting than others, but same-sex couple need not fear 
                    coming to Australia for any reason.

                        Be abashed by hearing a certain unpleasant four letter word beginning with 'C' and ending in 't'. Aussie 
                        male friends tend to use it with each other as a stand-in for 'mate' or 'buddy' on more than one occasion. Yes, 
                        it also retains its usual meaning and use, too, in case you were wondering. Context is definitely key
