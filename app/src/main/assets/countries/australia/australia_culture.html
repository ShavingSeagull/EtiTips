                    Australia has similarities to the United States in the sense that it has been born of multiple different cultures from the result 
                    of migration from Europe over the last couple of hundred years. Having very close ties to the United Kingdom that persist to this 
                    day in the form of cultural similarities, Australia has become a land known for its laid-back attitude and easy-going people.

                <p>
                    Though Christianity is the largest religion at 52% of the population (as of 2016), the state doesn't ally itself to any particular 
                    faith officially. The Christians in the country comprise large swathes of Catholics and Protestants alike, which is in contrast to 
                    most countries in Europe, where the majority of the populace overwhelmingly follow a particular branch of the faith. The irreligious 
                    total 30%, making them the second largest group in the country.

                    To conduct yourself well in Australian society, it would be a good idea to keep strong beliefs to yourself. As mentioned, the locals 
                    are very easy-going and won't appreicate being preached to, regardless of the faith in question. Aussies are very welcoming and hospitable, 
                    so you would be very unlikely to meet any resistance over following a particular faith or even just having one in the first place. Just be 
                    aware that they also love a good debate on occasion; it would be smart not to initiate it yourself, however.

				<p>
                    The general dress sense in Australia is on the casual side. It should be noted that this doesn't necessarily indicate lower standards; 
                    rather, it is mostly a result of the blistering weather that tends to occur in the country, especially on the west coast. That said, you 
                    should be sure to dress appropriately if eating in restaurants etc. Having the sense to dress for the occasion is really all you need to 
                    keep in mind!

                    Beer, cricket and barbecues. On to the next section!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ok, perhaps that was a <i>bit</i> of a generalisation. Though it's certainly true that all three of those things form a 
                    large part of typical Australian daily life. Sport is well received here, with cricket, rugby and Australian football being 
                    the local favourites; for good reason, too - Australia has one of the best national cricket and rugby teams in the World. It is 
                    certainly the case that if you want to strike up a conversation with a local, mentioning one of those three ventures would 
                    likely yield fruitful results - just bear any local rivalries in mind!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is rather easy to advise matters of etiquette in Australia because the overall nature is very laid-back. Truly, it is fairly 
                    difficult to make a glaring mistake here. Aussies like to be social and they like to get together for a beer and/or a barbecue. 
                    It is also extremely likely that you'll run into a local at some point who invites you for one or the other. Knowing someone for 
                    five minutes here is like knowing them for a lifetime and if/when such an event occurs, you should absolutely take them up on the 
                    offer. It can be a very alien concept to people from a lot of countries to be invited to functions by people they've just met, but 
                    there is no need to treat it with suspicion and it's a great way to meet some locals and have a bit of a cultural exchange!

                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Australian work life is much like the everyday life - laid-back and easy-going. That said, the locals tend to work rather hard 
                    and prefer to get as much done in the day as possible. This can come as a bit of a shock to foreigners, as the working weeks tend 
                    to be a little longer and the working days the same. Also different is the lack of hierarchy that is generally the case here, with 
                    employees encouraged to speak their minds and everyone encouraged to muck in together to get the work done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conducting business in Australia can be as easy or as difficult as you choose to make it. There are some key points to take note of here, 
                    as failing to do so could stand you in fairly bad stead. First up is time keeping. Don't mistake the laid-back nature of the locals to mean 
                    they don't care for time management. In fact, Australians tend to be sticklers for time keeping, as they like to get as much done in the day 
                    as possible. Next we have meeting protocols. Most foreigners will probably be taken aback by the shifting attitude during business meetings, 
                    as well as the overall casual nature. Pleasantries and small-talk will likely kick things off, but will be dispensed with quickly in exchange 
                    for hard business discussion. Don't be coy here - Australians are very direct and will tell you outright if they think your proposal is no good. 
                    Use this to your advantage though and explain your position in a manner that is as direct as theirs - no beating around the bush. Also, don't be 
                    afraid to indulge in the casual nature of the meeting, to a certain extent. Your Australian counterpart will likely introduce themselves with their 
                    first name and you can take this as a cue to address them by it. You may even be greeted with the traditional "G'day, mate", but be sure to 
                    respond with a standard "Hello" and don't try to emulate the casual greeting, as this will actually come across as a bit rude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Modesty is important in business discussions as, while they tend to be rather direct, Australians don't value boastfulness at all. They may even 
                    downplay their own achievements during a meeting, but don't take this as a sign that the company isn't good to do business with - they are just 
                    being polite. Likewise, explain your proposal clearly and directly, but don't oversell it, as you'll be dismissed as a typical arrogant hot-air 
                    salesman. Lastly, two notes on communication: keep strong eye contact during meetings &amp; conversation in general and don't be abashed 
                    if you hear swearing during meetings or in the workplace in general. Swearing is an everyday part of life in Australia and is used to convey a range 
                    of emotions, not all of them negative. It would be wise to keep your own language professional, just be aware that you may hear some things you 
                    wouldn't normally expect.
