                    The United Kingdom has a rich culture spanning over a millennia. From the Anglo Saxon roots and the Viking invasion to the
                    conquest by the Normans, the British culture has had subtle influences over the years, yet has managed to retain its sense
                    of individuality. The British are a proud people, even if they sometimes choose not to show it on the surface.

                    The official language is English and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Though the official national religion is Christianity, the UK harbours people of many different faiths. It is not uncommon
                    to see churches, mosques, Buddhist or Sikh temples in the same city. As with most Western countries, the native population's
                    attitude to religious practice has waned over the years and as such, much of British life is secular in nature now. The UK
                    government has officially recognised a separation between church and state, though tolerance of institutions such as 
                    religious schools remain.

                    To conduct yourself well in British society, it is important not to force your beliefs on those around you. While British 
                    people are generally tolerant, they don't appreciate having things thrust upon them. Discussions about religion aren't
                    unusual here, but keep in mind that if you are religious, you will likely find yourself talking to someone who isn't.
                    The native people have a general desire to agree to disagree and following suit will serve you well.

                    The general dress sense in the UK is the same as anywhere else in the Western world: t-shirts, jeans, suits, shorts,
                    dresses, tanktops etc. There is no religious reason to cover oneself and no cultural stigma against wearing clothing
                    that leaves little to the imagination. The rule of thumb is that if you want to wear it, you can. That should make
                    your choice of outfits to put in your suitcase a bit easier!

                    British people are somewhat known for keeping themselves to themselves. With the rise of the metropolitan lifestyle,
                    people's attitude to talking to strangers is seen as suspicious more than friendly these days. That being said, if
                    you stop a local to speak to them (perhaps for directions etc), they are likely to be willing to help. This change of
                    culture has had the effect of making most people very appreciative of those who make an effort socially, so if you want
                    to make friends either in a work or recreational setting, don't be afraid to speak up!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The guarded nature of the British carries over into their general behaviour, too. In countries like Australia, it isn't
                    uncommon to be welcomed into a person's home whom you've just met and be offered a roof over your head soon after! The 
                    opposite is true in the UK, however. If you wish to visit a neighbour or a friend, text or call them first; turning up
                    at the doorstep out of the blue is considered rather impolite! Likewise, if you find yourself in need of sudden help or
                    a place to stay, do try and resolve the situation as best you can before turning to others. The general social grace of
                    the British will ultimately lead to them agreeing to help, but they will likely feel put-out by doing so. The attitude
                    of keeping yourself to yourself really does apply here.

                <p>
                    While the general culture isn't geared toward living for your job, people in the UK do take their work seriously,
                    especially in professional office-based roles. If it is business that brings you to the UK or perhaps the start
                    of a new life here, it is important to keep in mind that good communication skills will serve you well. The 
                    English language is brimming with a large vocabulary and as the original purveyors of it, the British
                    tend to appreciate a good command of the language in a professional setting. A tendency to try with the English
                    language will always be appreciated here, but if you are able to grasp it well, it will certainly serve you well
                    in your career or business dealings.
                </p>

                    There tends to be a healthy sense of comradery in the British workplace. While office politics will undoubtedly
                    appear as it does everywhere, colleagues enjoy going for a drink at the nearest pub after work, usually on a Friday.
                    While it is never a requirement to attend, it will stand you in good stead with the locals if you do - the British 
                    do enjoy a good drink after all. Don't worry if you don't drink alcohol - it is the fact you have made the effort to
                    attend that will be appreciated. There doesn't tend to be many office-retreat style occasions in British work life, so
                    to make the effort to get to know your colleagues in a less formal setting will only be a benefit to you if you wish
                    to fit in to British working culture.
