                    Not a nation overly famed for its cuisine, the UK does, however, host a very diverse selection of other cultures' cuisine, 
                    as well as a famous selection of fine dining establishments. It is common to find streets lined with Chinese, Indian, Italian, 
                    French, Spanish and Japanese restaurants, to name a few. If you have a taste for something, you'll likely find a place nearby.

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: 10% of bill</strong>

                <p>
                    Tipping in the realm of food and drink is quite straight forward in the UK. If you eat at a restaurant, you 
                    are expected to leave a tip for the waiter. 10% is generally the stated amount, but £2-3 is usually what is given,
                    unless you are dining at a higher class establishment. Wait staff earn at least the minimum wage (often a little more),
                    so don't feel that you have to leave a huge sum for them to make ends meet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some restaurants (especially in London) choose to add a service charge to your bill. This can be removed upon request
                    and if a service charge is included, you definitely should not leave a tip - the charge <i>is</i> the tip. A little 
                    presumptive, but it is optional.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>

                <p>
                    Tipping in pubs in the UK is not expected at all. Some establishments will have a tip jar, but there is no expectation
                    to use it. However, a phrase you may hear when someone orders a drink is "and one for yourself". If someone wishes to show their
                    appreciation, that is usually the way they do it. The barman/woman will either pour themselves a drink there and then or
                    put the money aside to use later. This is most common with patrons who visit a regular establishment and know the bar staff well,
                    though it can be practiced by anyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike in restaurants, there is no expectation to tip when eating at a pub. It is of course entirely up to you if you wish to
                    leave a few Pounds behind when you leave, but it isn't expected and won't be frowned upon if you don't. A lot of establishments
                    are merging pub and restaurant together these days and if you aren't sure if the venue is more pub than restaurant, it may be a 
                    safe option to leave a small tip just in case, but this is of course entirely up to you.

                    Cafés are where life is easiest when tipping in the UK. It is extremely unusual to see anyone tip in a highstreet café, so 
                    don't feel that you have to. A simple "thank you" as you leave will suffice and it isn't uncommon to see customers, even new
                    ones, offers thanks as they leave the café.

                    When toasting in the UK, the word to use is, of course, "Cheers!". If clinking glasses, some people will look at their
                    glass and others will look at the other person; it is merely personal preference.

                    Today, it is very common to see groups of friends split the bill in a restaurant. You can mention to the restaurant that
                    you wish to split the bill before you order, but it isn't overly necessary. There are plenty of apps that can handle the
                    number-crunching for you or even a good old calculator will suffice. Some people do choose to only pay for what they
                    ordered, which may make logical sense, but often it will be the case that the bill will be split in equal parts between
                    the number of people at the table.

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in the UK, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Keep your elbows off the table while eating</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>Use your cutlery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be mindful of your language when eating in public venues. There are likely to be children around you</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, remember to thank them for the meal when you have finished. A common phrase to use is, 
                        "That was lovely, -insert name-, thank you"
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

					<li>
                        Make a scene in a restaurant if there is a problem with your service. Simply have a quiet word with the manager and
                        you'll likely find the situation resolved immediately. They will appreciate you preserving the reputation and 
                        atmosphere of the establishment and in turn, be more likely to help you.
                    </li>
