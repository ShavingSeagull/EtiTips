                    Japan has a unique, rich Oriental culture that has developed its own style as well as borrowed from neighbouring areas over 
                    the millennia to create a country and society that is both respected and envied by many in other parts of the world today. A 
                    homogenous society of patriotic people, the Japanese are known for their overwhelming work ethic and dedication, as well as their 
                    strict etiquette and protocols.

                    The official language is Japanese and the national religion is Shinto.

                <h3 class="section-header">Religion</h3>
                <p>
                    Though the national religion is technically Shinto if you take into account the number of people who participate in Shinto 
                    festivals and events, the vast majority of Japanese people officially identify as irreligious. It tends to be the case that 
                    the native people hold an affiliation to the Shinto faith without recognising it in a formal format, such as on a census. 
                    Buddhism is also present in a large capacity in Japan and it isn't uncommon to find people practising Shinto and Buddhism 
                    side-by-side. Despite the presence of the United States during the Meiji Period, Christianity remains a minority religion in Japan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conducting yourself well in Japanese society with regards to religion is certainly easier than some other countries, owing 
                    to the largely irreligious population. Whether you believe in something or not, few people will take much notice here. That 
                    said, it would be wise not to try and push your beliefs on the local people, as this would come across as very rude. The Shinto 
                    shrines are a hugely popular attraction, both for the locals and tourists alike. It is common to see high school students 
                    ringing the bell and saying a prayer on the day of a big exam, as well as writing messages asking for good fortune. Whether 
                    you're a foreigner or not, you'll be invited to partake in the custom and it would be an interesting experience to do so!

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    The general dress sense in Japan is similar to the Western world: t-shirts, jeans, suits, trousers, dresses etc. 
                    There is no religious reason to cover oneself, although it wouldn't be wise to glavant around Tokyo in something that is 
                    more suited to a beach. Traditional Japanese clothing, such as the Yukata, is worn during festivals and the like. So, uh, don't 
                    plan on walking around the city dressed like someone from the feudal era as you will certainly draw a few stares. Do feel free to 
                    take part during any such festive occasion, though!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business dress is dark and conservative. The key is to try and blend in with your co-workers, so nothing flashy, which includes 
                    an abundance of jewellery. Dark suits (though try to avoid black as it's a funeral colour) are definitely the way to go and make sure it fits you 
                    well.

                <p>
                    Though this is the Everyday Life section, we have to mention the Japanese work ethic here because it really does feature in 
                    the daily lives of almost all native people. The Japanese work a <i>lot</i> and they work hard. Unfortunately, there is a reason 
                    the suicide rate is so high here and it is partially due to most people being vastly overworked. The flip side to this is that 
                    the nation is industrious and prosperous, which benefits everyone who lives there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enough doom and gloom about being overworked! The bright side is that, despite declining birth rates due to overworking, when the 
                    Japanese do have families, they are held in high regard. Elders are treated with the greatest respect, which is partially due to the 
                    famed honour system that many in the West now envy, owing to their own societal standards declining in recent decades. The Japanese 
                    family unit tends to be traditional, with the mother taking up the position of housewife to keep the home together and raise the 
                    children while the father works hard in the daily grind to provide for his family. In recent times this has changed a little, as 
                    some families require the income of both parents to keep the family afloat. Generally speaking, however, the goal is to pursue the 
                    traditional family unit, so this can be useful to bear in mind if you are dating or married to a local.

                    Typical Japanese cultural pursuits include partaking in the plethora of historical sites and onsens (hot spring) dotted around the country. 
                    Seeing as 90% of the population lives in urban areas, such as Tokyo, being able to travel further afield to visit a castle or a temple is a hugely 
                    attractive proposition for many. Sport is also popular for many people here, with baseball and figure/ice skating being two particularly 
                    favoured past times.

                    A note about 'racism': Many foreign people comment that Japan is 'racist'. To put it simply, this is fundamentally untrue. As mentioned, 
                    Japan is a largely homogenous society with a proud native population. The concept of the Japanese disliking foreigners stems from 
                    foreign people behaving poorly while in Japan and failing to show the proper respect to the local customs and culture. Failing to 
                    integrate will make you unpopular in any country, not just Japan. If you are a tourist, you are expected to behave properly and show the 
                    necessary respect for the local culture. If you are moving to Japan and living there, you are expected to integrate as much as possible 
                    and live as the locals do. That is the truth behind the Japanese 'racist' mystery. Try speaking to a local and you'll find they'll take a great 
                    interest in you <i>because</i> you're foreign. Not exactly what we'd call racist...

                <p>
                    As we mentioned above, the Japanese work ethic is probably unrivalled by any nation on the planet. While that may sound positive on the surface, 
                    it naturally has downsides, as a tendency to overwork leads to a lack of personal time and a lot of stress. This attitude to working must 
                    absolutely be taken into consideration if you are planning on living in Japan. While not every profession works itself to the bone, if you are 
                    working in an office environment, it is possible that you will encounter the overworking culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For all the hard work, you may be pleased to hear that the Japanese like to enjoy the end of the daily grind, too. You will often see colleagues 
                    drinking together after work and not just on a Friday. In fact, drinking with colleagues is almost a requirement in some Japanese work places, as 
                    taking part gives you the image of a team player and raises comradery. Work places follow the traditional hierarchical structure, however, so don't 
                    plan on inviting your boss for a drink, as this would be viewed as rather disrespectful!

                    Conducting business in Japan? Then pay attention to the following few tips as, like with the rest of Japanese culture, business proceedings will 
                    follow a strict cultural protocol. Business in Japan is formal - <i>really</i> formal. There is correct etiquette for almost every facet of a 
                    meeting and failing to adhere to these customs can leave you with egg on your face and hopes of a deal in the clouds. Let's start with business cards and greetings. 
                    In the West, business cards are in their twilight years, but in Japan the humble business card is still king. When receiving somebody's card, you should accept 
                    it with both hands, give a moment to read the card and then do one of two things: if you are standing, place it into your business card holder after 
                    reading it; if you are seated, place it on the table next to you after reading it. It should remain there until the meeting gets into full swing, at 
                    which point it can be deftly put away while people are distracted. You can also follow your Japanese counterpart and put his card away when he puts yours away. 
                    Likewise, when offering your card, you should do so with both hands, Japanese printed side face up and give a bow as you offer the card. As for greetings, 
                    always be prepared to bow as the locals do, which will very likely impress them. The Japanese rarely shake hands, though if they do extend their hand, don't give it a 
                    hearty shake as you may be used to in your country. A softer shake is a much better choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will likely be offered green tea during a meeting, but you shouldn't take a sip immediately. Instead, wait until your counterpart takes their first sip, then 
                    it is safe to start drinking yours. An important note, which can seem counterintuitive depending on where you're from, is that silence is golden in business 
                    meetings, especially during the first one. Silence is seen as a show of respect and possession of sound thought &amp; wisdom. Trying to make constant small-talk 
                    is seen as an attempt to rush things along, which won't end well; likewise, asking personal things is strictly out of the question. Following on from that point is 
                    the method of selling. The hard sell <i>won't</i> work in Japan. Period. Attempting to pressure your counterpart will absolutely result in you being dismissed. Instead, 
                    take the approach of subtle persuasion, using facts and figures to prove that what you're stating is beneficial from a logical point of view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gift giving is important in most Oriental cultures and Japan is no different. However, there are many opportunities to get it very wrong. Many variations of flower 
                    are associated with funerals, so flowers are best avoided altogether. The best gifts are those that are representative of the place you are from. As a foreigner in 
                    Japan for business, you will have lots of opportunity to give something that will be of interest to them. Candies or such treats are useful choices, though it is the 
                    gesture of gift giving that matters more than the content. Don't ever bring a gift for one person and not the other; likewise, don't give the same gift to two people 
                    of differing rank, as this would be disrespectful to the higher ranked person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we'll talk about time keeping. The Japanese are sticklers for good time keeping, so be sure to turn up early. Around 20 minutes before the meeting is a good choice 
                    and it is best to phone around two hours before to confirm your attendence. If you have to cancel unexpectedly, do so at the earliest moment. The Japanese place huge 
                    emphasis on reliability, so do everything you can to prove you are a safe pair of hands, so to speak. Finally - and this wouldn't be a Japanese culture section without 
                    mentioning it - but you may have to attend a karaoke bar during business. This is a famously loved past time in Japan and, yes, you will absolutely be expected to 
                    sing. A source of mortal dread for many, we're sure, though don't worry about being horrendously out of tune, as your counterparts likely will be, too.
