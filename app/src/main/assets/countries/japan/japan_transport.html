                    Japan boasts one of the greatest public transport networks in the world, with bus, metro and multiple rail options, 
                    including the world famous Shinkansen (Bullet Train). Every major city has a vast metro network that is very safe, 
                    very clean and very reliable. The same goes for the overland rail options, which provide excellent ways to travel 
                    between large cities and regions. Buses are rarely used in the cities because the metro network is so good, but that 
                    option, too, is reliable and safe.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with every other service in the country, tipping is not required in Japan and should be actively avoided for the reasons 
                    stated over on the Food &amp; Drink tab. Good service is expected in the price you pay for the fare, so any extra is totally 
                    unnecessary and can actually be seen as an insult.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour are very high on Japanese public transportation - the trains in particular. Under no circumstance 
                    should you make or receive a phone call while on the train, as this is highly rude. What you can do - and will see others do - 
                    is to answer your phone, quickly and quietly state you're on the train (thus unable to speak) and that you'll call them back 
                    once you disembark. Even an employer in Japan would understand this circumstance, as the etiquette is that important here. 
                    Likewise, speaking in general on the trains is viewed rather negatively, too. Be very quiet if you must speak to someone on the train 
                    and, if you can, just don't speak at all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The trains and stations in Japan get busy - <i>really</i> busy. Don't mistake this as chaos, however. There is a sense of order, 
                    even when lining up for a train or buying tickets etc. It is common to see people stand in pairs or form a single file to wait for 
                    a train and this attitude carries over when it comes time to board, too; stand aside to let passengers disembark before boarding the 
                    train yourself. Once on the train, move further inside straight away so that you don't block the doorway. Embarking and disembarking 
                    tends to happen quite quickly, so be sure to stay on your toes.

                    Some trains utilise a carriage for women only in the mornings. This was the authorities' response to groping incidents on busy rail 
                    services that would occur during rush hour. These carriages are identified by a pink sign that identifies which one will be for women 
                    only or by pink signs or seats in the carriage itself. If you find yourself on a women only carriage as a man, you can simply leave 
                    through the sliding door that connects the carriage to others when you realise your mistake. If somebody notifies you of your error, 
                    a quick "Sumimasen" (excuse me) and a bow will save face while you leave the carriage. Foreign tourists will obviously be expected to make 
                    such errors on occasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do be sure to give up your seat to somebody vulnerable, such as the elderly, a pregnant woman or someone with a disability. There are 
                    special seats near the door for these people which are often coloured differently. You can make use of them if the train isn't busy, but 
                    be sure to give up the seat as soon as a vulnerable person enters the carriage. The locals will be judged badly for failing to do so, but 
                    as a foreigner, you'll be doing your countrymen no favours at all by disrespecting the local etiquette.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, eating and drinking on public transport is frowned upon in Japan (with the exception of the long distance services on the Shinkansen - there will 
                    even be a snacks trolley come round to purchase refreshments). You won't typically see many people walking while eating or drinking 
                    on the street either and it's for the same reason. Drinking water on the train is acceptable, as carriages can get warm during the summer, but anything 
                    other than water should be avoided. So, you've finished your water - what do you do with the empty bottle? Take it with you! Japan is a very clean 
                    country and this includes the transport. The locals carry all of their trash with them until they find a bin to put it in. Even newspapers shouldn't 
                    be left on the train when you disembark. Most of us have seen the footage of Japanese fans cleaning the stadium after an event at the World Cup or the 
                    Olympics, for example. This is the aforementioned attitude to cleanliness at work for all to see. Even the streets in the homeless areas of big cities 
                    are pristine, so do be sure to follow suit by disposing of any and all trash you produce while out and about!
