                    Famous for a multitude of reasons, such as the Samurai, anime, cherry blossom trees and a love of karaoke, Japan is 
                    one of the most popular holiday destinations around, especially for westerners. The country's history dates back thousands 
                    of years, with archaeological finds proving the land was inhabited as much as ten thousand years ago and perhaps beyond. 
                    Today, the island nation is the world's third largest economy and a leader in technological advancement.

				<p>
                    Japanese society has always been centred around honour and not much has changed in the modern day. The people put a strong 
                    emphasis on behaving properly, conducting oneself with decorum and not making an unnecessary scene. While neighbours of countries 
                    like China, where the people share a common ancestry, the standard of social grace between them is tangible. The Japanese won't take 
                    kindly to obnoxious foreigners shouting down the street and failing to adhere to the local social customs. Japan is very homogenous 
                    and very proud of itself; you should make a great effort to conduct yourself properly when visiting the country for any reason.

                    Shop staff and service staff are notably friendly here and will welcome new customers who walk in. You aren't required to say anything 
                    back (they're only saying "Welcome to the store" anyway), but a warm smile would go a long way. Likewise, while 90% of the population lives 
                    in urban areas like Tokyo, with typically busy metropolitan lives, the Japanese people aren't cold and unfriendly by any means. The locals take 
                    an interest in foreigners (especially westerners) and enjoy a good laugh. If you know any Japanese language and have the guts to use it, you could make 
                    friends fairly quickly here. It also helps if you like to drink...

                    We imagine most people reading this will be aware of the famous bow greeting. Don't go around bowing to everybody you meet, however. The act 
                    of bowing is used to show great respect (such as when speaking to a superior) or to apologise profusely for a mistake. The average people on the street 
                    won't bow to each other unless the situation requires it. Don't be surprised to see serving staff bowing to you in upper scale restaurants, however - the 
                    customer is always king in Japan.

                    A note on English speaking: it is fair to say that most Japanese people don't speak English. Naturally, with each passing generation, the youth become more 
                    and more interested in speaking the world's lingua franca, but the overall standard is still very broken. Hotel staff will speak English to an acceptable 
                    standard, as would be expected, but don't expect the man on the street to understand what you're saying unless you're lucky. If you know any Japanese, even some 
                    simple words (like the ones listed below), you'll manage to get by and make a good impression at the same time.

                    Dating in Japan can be challenging. The mentality towards work life leaves little time for people to engage in personal pleasures, which is no doubt at least partly 
                    the reason for the country's low birth rate. The language barrier mentioned above may also make dating tricky if you don't speak at least some degree of Japanese. 
                    A note for the western men: a lot of younger Japanese women these days take a great shine to western men. This tends to be for two reasons: a good degree of Japanese 
                    women consider western men attractive and they are desperate for a native english speaker to practice their fledgling language skills with. These women are colloquially 
                    referred to as 'Gaijin Hunters', as <i>gaijin</i> means 'foreigner' in Japanese. Handy if you're also wanting to practice your Japanese, we're sure...

                <p>
                    As for couples coming to Japan on holiday, the rules are pretty simple - keep those hands and lips where we can see them! As mentioned above, the Japanese employ a good 
                    standard of social etiquette in public and eating your partner's face off in front of others most certainly doesn't factor into those standards. Keep private activities 
                    for private venues and you'll be just fine.

                <p>
                        Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting Japan. 
                        Learning a few could also help you make a good impression on the locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses ().

                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">

                    <li><b>こんばんは</b> (kon-ban-wa) - <i>Good evening/general greeting</i>. Used after the sun goes down.</li>
                    <li><b>ありがとございます</b> (aree-gatto go-zai-mas) - <i>Thank you very much</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>ありがと</b> (aree-gatto) - <i>Thanks</i>. More informal than the above, but acceptable in virtually any occasion.</li>
                    <li><b>お願いします</b> (o-ne-gai-shee-mas) - <i>Please</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>こんにちは</b> (kon-nee-chee-wa) - <i>Hello</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>さようなら</b> (sa-yo-na-ra) - <i>Good bye</i>. This is fairly formal and not used between friends who will see each other again soon.</li>

                    <li><b>いいえ</b> (ee-ye) - <i>No</i>. Make sure to hold the beginning 'ee' sound a bit, as a short 'ee-ye' (いえ) means 'house'!</li>
                    <li><b>ごめんなさい</b> (go-men-na-sai) - <i>Sorry</i>. Used for when you're actually apologising, not for saying "Excuse me".</li>
