                    Japan's cuisine might not be quite as famous as its neighbour China's, but it has gained massive popularity in the west and beyond in 
                    the last few decades, with restaurants as well as fast food options opening in most countries. We're sure everybody reading this will instantly 
                    think of sushi when thinking about Japanese cuisine and this is indeed a very popular option in the country (much cheaper there, too!). Typical 
                    local dishes tend to be centered around seafood (though by no means exclusively), East Asian vegetables, noodles and rice. The Japanese are also famed for 
                    their rice wine, Sake, as well as their whiskey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Sushi (bite-sized pieces of raw fish or other non-meat varieties on a bed of rice) and Takoyaki (ball shaped batter filled with octopus, ginger 
                    and green onion).

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping etiquette in Japan may be easier than anywhere else on the planet. Why? You don't tip. Yes, you read that correctly. No tips are required 
                    whatsoever; in fact, to do so can often be seen as a rude gesture, so don't think you should turn down our advice and 'try to be nice anyway', because 
                    it will very likely backfire. Leaving some money on the table after you leave the restaurant not only shows the business that you think they underpay their 
                    staff (they most certainly don't, by the way), but it may well result in your waiter running down the street after you to return the money.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are only two exceptions when it comes to tipping: a tour guide and a <i>Ryokan</i> (traditional Japanese inn). Tour guides <i>can</i> be tipped, though 
                    it will by no means be an easy endeavour and may be refused. As for <i>Ryokans</i>, these establishments tend to give a level of service that borders on the 
                    super human and for this, tipping is seen as acceptable. There is, however, a very strict tipping etiquette for both of these scenarios. You must put crisp notes 
                    in a special envelope and hand it to your tour guide or leave it in your <i>Ryokan</i> room. You should <b>NEVER</b> hand over cash to anyone for a tip, as this is 
                    considered highly rude. As for the special envelopes we mentioned - these can be bought almost anywhere as giving money is a big part of Oriental culture, though be 
                    sure to get one that is appropriate! Some are used for funerals etc. If all else fails, you can simply place the notes in a clean, blank, folded sheet of paper. 
                    Alternatively for tour guides, you can offer to buy them a tea or some lunch in lieu of a monetary tip - this is acceptable as well and perhaps a lot easier than 
                    dealing with gift-giving envelopes etc.

                <p>
                    When toasting in Japan, the word to use is "乾杯!" (pronounced "Kan-pai!"). The Japanese like to drink with friends and colleagues, 
                    so you may hear this a lot. Unlike in neighbouring China, you are not expected to finish the drink in one go after saying Kanpai.

                <p>
                    The Japanese have a rather set cultural precedent for paying for guests. When you're in Japan on holiday, you are a guest and so any 
                    local friends you may have will pay for dinner along with a lot of other things. It is considered rude to attempt to pay for yourself 
                    after it has been established that your Japanese friend will pay the entire bill - simply thank them for the meal and comment on how 
                    delicious it was. Likewise, however, if you end up hosting any Japanese friends in your country, they will expect you to pay for nearly 
                    everything as well!

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Japan, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, you may be sitting on the floor while eating at a very low table. In casual settings, the men will sit 
                        cross legged and the women will sit with both their legs to one side. In a more formal setting, everyone will sit on their knees unless 
                        they are unable to
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In restaurants and bars, you will likely be brought a hot steamed towel. Note that this is to clean your hands and you should absolutely not 
                        wipe your face with it. In people's homes, it is expected to wash your hands before eating
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Whether in public or at home, the Japanese will almost always say いただきます (eeta-daki-mas) before they start eating. Roughly translated, this means 
                        'I gratefully receive' or 'Thanks for the food'. It is akin in practice, though technically slightly different, to the famous 'Bon Appetit' that most people know, 
                        though it is said by everyone at the table, not just the host. It would impress the locals to join in with the custom!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Japan largely uses chopsticks (though decent restaurants will stock western cutlery, too), but there is an etiquette to handling them. Never leave them 
                        pointing up in a bowl of food as this is a custom involved with funerals. When talking at the dinner table, it is good practice to place your chopsticks 
                        on the chopstick stand next to your plate. Don't use them to point while you're talking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unlike in the West, where bringing your crockery to your mouth is extremely bad manners, in Japan it is expected for smaller bowls, such as rice bowls. 
                        It can greatly aid in not spilling food, especially when using chopsticks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slurping when eating noodles or soup isn't considered bad manners at all; in fact, it shows you are enjoying the food! Again, bringing the bowl to your mouth as 
                        you eat will be the usual practice
                    </li>
                    <li>Miso soup should be drank rather than eaten. You pick the solid bits out with your chopsticks when the soup is gone</li>
                    <li>Don't eat directly from communal plates. Use the serving spoon or utensil provided to place some of the food onto your plate</li>
                    <li>
                        When eating sushi, don't mix the wasabi into the soy sauce as this is insulting to the chef. Unfortunately, a lot of Western sushi connoisseurs have yet to get the 
                        memo...
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should strive to finish everything on the plate, even plain rice, as this indicates you enjoyed the meal. Obviously, this is much more important if you're eating in 
                        somebody's home
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of western cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to wait to be seated. They may have a seating plan in mind for a proper dinner function</li>
                    <li>It is good manners to bring a small gift if eating at somebody's home. Special expensive teas or a good quality liquor work well</li>
                </ul>

                        Be afraid to try the local delicacies, such as sushi. The thought of raw fish can be off-putting for many non-Oriental people, but it is
