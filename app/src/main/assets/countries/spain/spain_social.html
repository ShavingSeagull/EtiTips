                    Siesta, fiesta and sangria. These may be the first things to enter your mind when you think of Spain and that's quite understandable - 
                    Spain is famed for its festivals, food & drink and a "it's done when it's done" attitude. Spanish history has been filled with imperial 
                    expansion (there's a reason most of South America speaks Spanish), art, culture and shifting demographics. One of the World's cultural 
                    hotspots, you'd be hard-pressed not to find something to pique your interest in España.

                    Greetings are an important social custom in Spain. Whether meeting someone for the first time or the hundreth, you are expected to greet them 
                    when you meet and give a farewell when you part ways. Typically, this will be by using <i>Buenos Dias/Buenas Tardes/Buenas Noches</i> (good morning/
                    good afternoon/good evening), with a simple <i>Adiós</i> (goodbye) as a farewell. Note, too, that when greeting someone, a handshake or an air kiss 
                    is expected - a handshake for men (or a hug for friends) and an air kiss on both cheeks (starting with the left) for a man and a woman or two women. 
                    Yes, gents, even if you don't know the woman well, you are expected to greet with a kiss.

                    The Spanish are a rather easy-going bunch and to do well in Spain you should definitely follow suit. Being loud, abrasive or rude is a big no-no here, 
                    as is flaunting wealth and boasting. Modesty, respect and courtesy are the orders of the day, whether you're in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia or anywhere 
                    inbetween.
                </p>

                    The concept of 'personal space' also doesn't exist much in Spain. It is very commonplace and an accepted practice to include physicality during conversation - 
                    think pats on the shoulder or touches of the arm etc. For some, this is as natural as breathing, but for others it can cause a simulation of a cat jumping 
                    out of its skin. Cultures tend to vary heavily in their social practices, but at least you can consider yourself warned if you are from a culture that 
                    doesn't practice much physicality in their social engagements.

                    Finally, a word on English speaking: in cities, you should fare rather well, as is the case with most places in Europe. As is also usually the case, the level 
                    of English speakers drops the more into the countryside you travel. Even in cities, don't be alarmed if the passerby you stopped for directions doesn't 
                    understand you. In such cases, it would be best to ask at a hotel or restaurant, or approach someone under the age of 30 - the youth are embracing speaking 
                    English as a second language much more than the generations before them.

                    Romance in Spain is...difficult. We have all seen the films, I'm sure, where a Carlos or a Juan sweeps the femme fatale off her feet, but the reality is very 
                    different. Outside of Madrid (and even in Madrid a lot of the time), attempting a romantic venture will often fall flat, as it relies heavily on one's social 
                    circle than anything else. The concept of 'dating' doesn't really exist in Spain, so how do people meet each other? Usually, they are already friends or they 
                    meet through friends of friends. The old tried and trusted method everywhere once upon a time, but in Spain it remains the primary avenue for relationships to 
                    start. Online dating does exist here, but that is certainly more of a Madrid thing than anything else.

                <p>
                    If you do manage to hit it off, however, know that relationships in Spain can function a little differently than other places. Both men and women like to be in 
                    contact with their significant other very often and can come across as intense or 'clingy', depending on what you are used to. This stems from a romantic culture 
                    steeped in tradition and passion, rather than a concept of smothering or control. Foreigners will also typically find it harder to form a romantic bond with a local than 
                    a fellow local will. There is a reason a significant portion of expats end up dating other expats.
