                    Spain boasts an impressive public transport network, with trains, a variety of bus systems (both short and long distance 
                    available) and even trams in a few areas. Large cities, such as Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia also boast a metro 
                    system, which can be useful in avoiding the typically heavy traffic of a metropolitan area.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>

                <p>
                    As with much of the rest of Spain, tipping taxi drivers is by no means an expected custom. You would be hard-pressed to find a local 
                    tipping a driver, so it's safe to follow suit. Of course, if the driver has helped you with mountains of luggage or rushed frantically 
                    so you wouldn't miss your flight home, leaving a little something certainly wouldn't be turned down!

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Like the rest of the country, people are generally well behaved on public transport in Spain. Taking phone
                    calls is permitted on transport, but it is best to keep your voice down as much as you can; if you find people glaring at you, you have 
                    probably been too loud. Contrary to expectation for such a hot country, not all buses have air conditioning in Spain and in the summer during 
                    busy periods, it can get very uncomfortable. Think of your fellow passengers and make sure you wear deodorant...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, especially on city buses as there is minimal seating to make 
                    way for standing passengers. Do the right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. You are representing your country when you go abroad, 
                    so making the effort to act courteously will leave a positive impression on the locals.
                </p>

                        Be afraid to indulge in the local transport network. While the buses can sometimes be confusing, the 
                        trains and metro can be a great way to get around the cities and country at large
