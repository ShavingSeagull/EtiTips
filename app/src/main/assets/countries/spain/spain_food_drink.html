                    Spain, like neigbouring France and Italy across the water, is a country famed for its food. Tapas bars have sprung up all over 
                    western Europe and, while not a food in itself (it's a serving style), the dishes that come along with it most certainly are. 
                    Accompanied by a large array of great wines and the world famous sangria, Spain offers a broad cuisine that is sure to appeal 
                    to most who try it.

                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Gazpacho (cold tomato soup) and Paella (seafood or meat rice).

                <p>
                    Unlike some of its neighbours and close relatives, there <i>is</i> a tipping culture in Spain, though it is by no means very large. The general 
                    rule of thumb is a little will go a long way, but there is a caveat with evening meals in restaurants. In such cases, it is best to tip 
                    around 5-10% of the bill, as more preparation goes in to larger evening meals than smaller afternoon lunches. Also, it is quite possible 
                    that your waiter will go above and beyond, such as providing a friendly face and some entertainment for your children, as kids are hugely 
                    favoured in Spanish society. Naturally, adjust your tip accordingly for less-than-great experiences!

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in Spain isn't expected at all. You can always round up the bill to the nearest Euro if you wish, 
                    but it isn't an expected custom. If you are receiving table service, giving a little something might be a nice gesture. Not mandatory 
                    by any means, but a Euro wouldn't go amiss.

                <p>
                    Unlike with restaurants, there is no expectation to tip at cafés in Spain. Most people will just stop off for a coffee, which absolutely doesn't 
                    require you leave anything, even if sitting at a table. Should you make full use of the facilities, such as taking your army of children to the 
                    toilet etc, it might be polite to round the bill to the nearest Euro, but certainly no more than that. All wait staff, whether in cafés or 
                    restaurants, are paid a living wage for what they do. Tips are not required to make ends meet here.

                    When toasting in Spain, the word to use is "Salud!" (pronounced sa-loo). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                <p>
                    It is fairly typical in Spain that the person who invited the other will pay the entire bill; however, it is polite to offer to pay, even if you are the guest. 
                    The Spanish have nothing against splitting a bill (they even call it paying "a la Catalana" - the equivalent of "going Dutch"), but there is a certain way of doing it. 
                    Most restaurants will accept, but try to dissuade you, from paying with multiple credit cards because they have to pay a hefty fee for each one. So, if splitting the bill 
                    and paying by card, it is common practice for one person to pay the entire bill with their card and everyone else reimburse them with cash. Be sure to pay your tip in cash, too, 
                    if you want to make sure it goes to your waiter!

                    Perhaps unsurprisingly for a nation famed for its cuisine, there is a general standard expected at the dinner table. General household standards may have eased 
                    a bit over time, though the following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Spain, either in their homes or in public 
                    establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>You <b>have</b> to ask for your bill in a restaurant and even then you might not get it for a while. Tackling your waiter might be a more appropriate tactic</li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, wait for the most important person to start eating before you do. This will either be the host or the oldest person at the table</li>
                    <li>The host will sit at the head of the table, with their spouse on the opposite end. The most honoured guest will sit to the right of the host</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands on/above the table at all times, not just when eating. No elbows, though!</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Use your cultery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>Be prepared to take your time! Eating in Spain, especially at lunch time, is almost ceremonial and nobody likes to rush the experience</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is very good practice to bring a gift. Either chocolates, wine or flowers (not dahlias or chrysanthemums 
                        as these are associated with funerals) work well. It is also good form to bring a small gift for any children the host may have
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unlike many other western European countries, you won't receive your bread on a separate plate. Place your bread on the rim of your dinner plate or 
                        on the table next to it
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                        Throw your dirty napkins or olive pits on the floor in lower class bars <b>only</b>. Yes, seriously. Always check the floor for previous trash 
                        discarding before doing so, though.
