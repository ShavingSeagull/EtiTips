                    Spanish culture is dominated by food, drink, socialising and festivals. When one thinks of a rich cultural European nation, Spain 
                    is one of the first places to come to mind for most people, along with perhaps France or Italy and that's for good reason: with many 
                    a great sports star and a history that has spanned many hundreds of years, Spain has had an impact on the world like few others. Spanish 
                    is the second most natively spoken language in the world behind Chinese, with the vast majority of the Southern American continent 
                    speaking it as their first language.

                <p>
                    The official language is Spanish (with official regional alternatives, such as Catalan) and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Spain is majority Christian, with a massive 71% of the population identifying with the Roman Catholic branch of the faith (as of 2019). The 
                    second highest affiliation is non-religious, coming in at only 25% of the populace, showing that, unlike much of the rest of western Europe, 
                    the younger generations are not moving away from religious affiliations, although many hold an identity without actively practicing. Though 
                    typically seen as a fairly religious people, the Spanish constitution values secularism, with a clear line between church and state.

                <p>
                    Many Spanish, as with quite a few other things, can prove to be very passionate about their religion, so it would be wise to keep an err 
                    of decorum should you find yourself discussing the subject. It would be ill advised to chastise Christianity in front of Spaniards, as doing 
                    so will likely make you appear a 'pig-headed foreigner', so to speak. Discussing religion is a sensitive area in most places, but in countries 
                    like Spain, it's probably best just avoided altogether.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    The Spanish favour a surprising degree of order to their dress sense. They generally side with dressing well whatever the occasion (so leave your 
                    sweatpants at home!), but certain things should be worn in certain situations. A great example of this is swimwear/beachwear, which should only be 
                    worn at the beach. In some cities like Barcelona, it is even illegal to wear swimwear around the city and could land you a fine of €100-€200. It may 
                    sound obvious to keep swimwear on the beach, but we tend to let go of our sensibilities a bit when we go on holiday, especially to very warm countries 
                    like Spain. Nevertheless, dress well, dress sensibly and dress for the occasion!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heed this warning about dressing in churches: Spain has a beautiful variety of cathedrals and churches that are popular with tourists, but they are still 
                    places of worship and therefore a certain standard of dress is expected if you want to be let through the door. For the ladies, the shoulders (and cleavage, if any) 
                    should be covered (a light scarf will do) and for the gents, no bare chests and switch from shorts to any form of trouser if you can. Jeans, linen trousers 
                    and slacks are all fine. Sandals are acceptable for men and women, too.

                    As with Italy just over the water, time keeping isn't a huge thing in Spain. The running joke for expats hiring a contractor is that they work on 
                    'Spanish time'. Indeed, the pace of life is definitely a lot slower here, so it's best to put the idea of sticking to sharp schedules aside, whether 
                    you are moving to Spain or just here on holiday. Take your time and enjoy what the country has to offer - the locals certainly will.

                    Family is a hugely important concept in Spanish culture. Families here tend to be large and they tend to be close, so this is certainly something to 
                    bear in mind if you are dating/marrying a local, for example. The saying of 'marrying into the family' exists everywhere, but nowhere is it more 
                    applicable than in Spain. Boys will be close to their mothers and elders will be held in high esteem. Children are also massively respected in Spain, 
                    with most parents doting on their children constantly. This can be helpful in restaurants, for example, where a lot of waiters will make an effort to 
                    bring a smile to your children's faces, as this is the nature of the culture. As noted on the Food &amp; Drink tab, bringing a small gift for any children 
                    is also customary when eating at a Spanish host's house, so do bear this in mind if invited over by friends.

                <p>
                    Spanish businesses operate according to a traditional hierarchical structure, though this is gradually changing in the modern age. If conducting business with Spaniards, 
                    however, do bear rank and title in mind as they likely will be. The Spanish work day can seem very long to foreigners, but with two hours often being taken for lunch 
                    (and siesta, depending on where you are), the time is made up later, which results in work days ending at 7-8pm. Owing to the cultural importance of the afternoon 
                    meal, it is also very unwise to schedule any meetings or appointments between noon and 4pm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A foreigner in Spain for business? Then pay attention to the following tip as it may just save your deal: don't talk turkey at a lunch or dinner meeting! The Spanish 
                    like to conduct business with people they trust and meal times are for eating and socialising, not working. If you're invited to a meal-based meeting, spend the time 
                    getting to know your cohort personally rather than attempting to negotiate any business. If and when your associate wishes to talk business, they will likely do so 
                    at the office. Talking about sport (football/soccer in particular) or family life are two popular subjects here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A quick note about time keeping: while the Spanish typically operate according to 'Spanish time', this most certainly does not apply to work life. If you have a meeting scheduled 
                    at 9am, you better make sure you turn up on time!
