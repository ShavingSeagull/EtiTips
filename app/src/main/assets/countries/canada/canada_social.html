					Often incorrectly and unfairly lumped together with the United States, Canada is, in fact, its own country. Shocking, we know. Making up 
					the entire top half of the North American continent (barring Alaska), Canada is a vast and beautiful nation, with a people quite differing 
					in culture. While generally a typically modern western nation, the French-Canadian areas are, obviously, vastly French oriented. This has led 
					to Canada having a unique identity and culture aside from their powerful neighbours to the south.

					The capital city is Ottawa and the currency is the Canadian Dollar ($).

                    The stereotype of the polite Canadian uttering "Sorry" before every sentence isn't actually that far from the truth. 
                    While saying "Sorry" before <i>every</i> sentence is obviously an exaggeration, Canadians are, for the most part, a rather 
                    polite bunch. This attitude has been the crux of many an American joke, but in all honesty, being polite is surely better 
                    than the alternative? Nevertheless, remember to pack your manners when you come to Canada and you should get by just fine.

                    The egalitarian nature of the French has clearly bled into Canadian society at large. The people value individualism and 
                    equality above most other things, so it would definitely be wise to bear this in mind when dealing with the local populace. 
                    On the note of individualism: it is a touchy subject to being up America and/or Americans in Canada. Their similarity may be 
                    the butt of many a joke, but in reality Canadians hate being compared to their southern neighbours. While mentioning America 
                    in general isn't going to earn you a bop on the nose, talking about Americanisation in Canada most certainly will earn you 
                    some stern replies and glares. In the politetest way possible, of course.

                    The general attitude toward Canadians and Canada by foreigners, especially in Europe, is generally very good. It remains a 
                    popular place for western foreigners to emigrate to and this says a lot about the culture of the country and of the people, too. 
                    A generally western approach to social grace will be enough to make you well-received here; just remember to make extra use of 
                    "Please" and "Thank you"!
                </p>

                    The Canadian attitude to romance is fairly generic in a western sense. Naturally, if you find yourself looking for love in 
                    the French-Canadian areas, you would do well to read our social page for France here on EtiTips. It should be noted, however, 
                    that public displays of affection aren't likely to be well-received (at least in the non-French areas). Some people won't care, 
                    of course, but generally it is better to err on the side of restraint. Save your lovey-dovey moments for the privacy of your 
                    hotel/home!

                    Same sex relationships and marriages are legal in Canada and this should probably come as no surprise knowing Canadians' appreciation 
                    of egalitarianism. People have an array of differing views on the subject, of course, and they are all valid. However, seeing 
                    as you are reading this page, it is likely you're intending to visit Canada or you're already here and need a quick tip. So, to 
                    you we say: when in Rome, do as the Romans do. Or at least pretend to for the time you're here.

                        Be afraid to speak French, if you know it and you're in a French-Canadian area. In some places in particular, you'll even 
                        find people who don't speak English at all. Like two countries in one!
