                    Not a nation that springs to one's mind when thinking of cuisine, Canada does, however, have quite a selection. Owing to their 
                    naturally mixed culture, the food will change depending on where you go. In the historically British areas, the cuisine will 
                    more closely resemble that of the UK. In the historically French areas, the food will resemble that of France etc. Overall, the 
                    cuisine is closely related to most other western nations, but be on the look-out for the quintessentially Canadian dishes!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Poutine (fries with cheese curds and gravy) and Nanaimo Bars (custard flavoured butter-iced dessert).

                <p>
                    Lets open with one thing - like America, tipping exists virtually everywhere in Canada and it is taken rather seriously. The general rule of thumb 
                    is that if you have received a service from someone who isn't behind a counter, you tip them. Seriously, it's <i>that</i> widespread. This may
                    be the Food &amp; Drink tab, but we're going to have to break with protocol in this app and list a host of other services here
                    before we get to the restaurants, bars and cafés below, as usual. Taxis will still be listed on the Mass Transit tab as usual, too.
                    So, without further ado, lets whizz through the services not mentioned in the other sections in record quick time:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Quick aside: while comparing Canada to America is bad form, in the realm of tipping it is actually acceptable. A lot of people will use a tipping 
                    guide for the United States when they visit Canada because the customs surrounding it are extremely similar. Note, the tip should be applied to 
                    the <b>pre-tax</b> amount on the bill. A calculator will help.

                    <strong>- Wine Sommelier (if applicable): add a little extra for them to the final bill</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, tipping is a serious business in Canada. While most wait staff earn at least the minimum wage, tipping still goes toward 
                    their earnings and it is important to get it right. <b>Anything</b> under 15% of the bill will be noticed immediately and taken quite personally. 
                    It isn't unusual to see tips over 20% of the bill, though this is excessive and unnecessary unless the service was world class. For a lot of 
                    people, especially Europeans, 15-20% of the bill seems an extortionate amount to tip. Know, though, that not adhering to this will leave a very 
                    sour taste indeed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, a tip will always be necessary. However, in the event of a service charge appearing on your bill, it is usually safe not to leave 
                    anything extra. If in doubt of who receives the charge, however, just ask your waiter if that counts as their tip. If it doesn't, then leave 
                    the standard 15-20% for them. Service charges in restaurants aren't so common, though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not leaving a tip in a restaurant is virtually unheard of in Canada. Even if your service was poor, you'll be expected to leave at least
                    around 10%. Generally speaking, if you leave less than 15% of the bill, you should probably be planning on complaining to the manager, too.
                </p>

				<p>
					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: $1 per drink or leave the change</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bars aren't safe from the tipping system, either. If you are at a standard bar, you will be expected to tip the barman/barwoman around a 
                    Dollar per drink. This is an American custom that is often used in Canada, though it is also common to just say "Keep the change" and that, too, 
                    will be acceptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rules are a little different if you are being served at a table. In establishments that deliver table service, you should just add
                    the standard 15% to the final bill. Perhaps a little easier to remember than tipping for every drink, especially if you are from a country that doesn't
                    have a large tipping culture.

                <p>
                    Cafés are similar to bars in that the tip will be smaller because the items you're ordering are smaller. You can either leave your café server around 
                    15% of the bill before tax or just let them keep the change.

                    When toasting in Canada, the word to use is, of course, "Cheers!". If clinking glasses, it is a good idea to
                    maintain eye contact.

                    If you are invited out for a meal, it is typically expected that each person will pay for exactly what they ordered. This will often 
                    entail separate bills for each person, which the waiter will enjoy because they will receive a tip from each one! Offering to pay 
                    for somebody else isn't rude either, of course, just expect them to put up a fight.

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Canada, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>
                        Unlike neighbouring America, Canadians tend to use cutlery the European way. Hold the fork in your left hand and the knife in your right, 
                        whether you're using the knife or not. Don't put your knife down and switch the fork to your right hand. It is also acceptable to use your 
                        cutlery the American way, too
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Don't speak while you're chewing food. Again, this is probably obvious to some, but it isn't a requirement to others</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be mindful of your language when eating in public venues. There are likely to be children around you</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it's a nice gesture to bring a gift. There aren't strict rules, however, so some flowers or a
                        bottle of wine will suffice. Keep it small and subtle; a large display will be viewed as boastful. If eating in a French-Canadian 
                        household, make the wine a good quality French one!
                    </li>
                </ul>
