                    Canada is one of the few countries that have a distinct difference in culture at its core. The two overarching 
                    cultures being British and French, it is perhaps little surprise that the clear line between the two resulting from a 
                    (sometimes) friendly rivalry in Europe is reflected in Canada, too. While a lot of people are bilingual, when it comes to 
                    culture you're either <i>really</i> French oriented...or you're <i>really</i> not.

                    The official languages are English &amp; French and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    While Canada is majority Christian at 67% of the population (as of the 2011 census), it is by no means a religious 
                    country. The state holds no official affiliation anymore and the people, while largely believing in a deity, don't 
                    actively practice their religion at all. This decline in religious value reflects large parts of western Europe, where 
                    the same thing has been taking place over the last few decades.

                    Despite the general lack of religious interest, it would be unwise to discuss the subject openly in Canadian society. The 
                    locals like to avoid sensitive subjects and given the rather liberal nature of the nation, you would likely find yourself 
                    in hot water for chastising personal beliefs you do not agree with.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    The general dress sense in Canada is the same as anywhere else in the Western world: t-shirts, jeans, suits, shorts,
                    dresses, tanktops etc. There is no religious reason to cover oneself and no cultural stigma against wearing clothing
                    that leaves little to the imagination (in the appropriate setting, of course). The rule of thumb is that if you want 
                    to wear it, you can, though bear in mind Canadians aren't big on flashy displays. That should make the choice of 
                    outfits to put in your suitcase a bit easier!

                <p>
                    Canadians like to fill their time in various ways. With the impressive terrain and snowy mountains, it should come as no 
                    surprise that winter sports are rather popular here. So, if you enjoy skiing, snowboarding or skating, you've come to the 
                    right place!

                    Typically, the week is for work and the weekend is reserved for socialising, as is the case with most places. This will be 
                    more true in Quebec than anywhere else in the country, with the French attitude of vehemently not mixing work and play being 
                    prevelent.

                <p>
                    Generally speaking, with the mix of cultural heritage that exists in Canada, it is obviously the case that the local 
                    everyday culture will change depending on where you are. If you are from the western world, you can expect the non-French areas 
                    of the country to be rather familiar with what you know. If you happen to be from France, however, you can certainly expect 
                    places like Quebec to be a home away from home. Likewise, you'd be very well received there generally, too.

                <p>
                    Navigating the Canadian work culture is fairly straight-forward compared to some other countries in Europe, for example. Office life 
                    is similar to the American approach, where equality and openness are favoured rather than the stuff-shirt way of doing business that 
                    can sometimes be a little stifling. As always, there are differences in Quebec, where formality will play a much more important role, 
                    as it also does in France. Always remember to use a colleague's title!
                </p>

                    If you're in Canada on business, you're in luck. There are very few bells-and-whistles with Canadian business meetings, with the people 
                    preferring to dispense with the pleasantries and get down to business rather quickly. The 'time is money' approach of their southern 
                    neighbours doesn't apply so much here, but time keeping is still a valued concept. If you're attending a meeting with a Canadian cohort, 
                    it is better to just get on with it and to do so in a direct manner. If you're doing business in Quebec, it might be wise to have your business 
                    card printed double-sided, one side in English and the other in French. It is very unlikely your meeting partner would be unable to understand 
                    the English side, but it would set a very good impression if you presented a bilingual card, especially as a foreigner.
