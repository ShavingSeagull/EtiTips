                    Canada has an extensive public transport network, including bus, rail, subway, plane and ferry. Bus will be the primary 
                    method of travel to and from smaller towns, but most cities feature a subway system and there are numerous rail options 
                    for short and long distance travel. Owing to its vast size, travelling by air will often be the primary mode of travel, 
                    epecially if you're planning on visiting many places in the country.

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: 15% of fare</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with virtually every other service in Canada, you are expected to tip your taxi driver at the end of 
                    the journey. Generally speaking, this will be around 15% of the total fare, but you can of course give a little more 
                    or a little less, depending on your service. If your driver has helped you with luggage on an airport run, it might 
                    be nice to give a little extra. 
                </p>

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour on Canadian public transport systems are generally good, with the mild manners of the people transferring 
                    to the way they behave on transport. Buses and trains can often get busy during peak periods, so be sure to apologise for nudging 
                    or bumping into someone. Keep your feet of the seats and keep noise to a minimum.
				</p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to give your seat up for somebody vulnerable, such as an elderly person or someone disabled. Remember, when you travel to 
                    other countries you are serving as an ambassador for your own. It will set a very good precedent if you do the right thing and aid 
                    those who need it where you can. It won't cost you anything and won't inconvenience you for more than a matter of minutes.
                </p>
