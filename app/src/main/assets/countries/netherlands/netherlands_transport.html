                    The Netherlands has one of the best developed public transport systems in Europe, boasting rail, tram, metro, 
                    bus and even ferry. There are many different types of train - some for city-to-city travel, some for intracity
                    travel - so you can always find a way to get from Den Haag to Groningen.

                <p>
                    As with every other service in the Netherlands, taxis don't require tipping. There is actually a service charge
                    applied to the bill automatically (which may seem odd for a taxi), hence the lack of need to tip the driver. That
                    being said, it is absolutely acceptable to round off the bill, so to speak. For example, if your fare was €6.70, you
                    could just give 30c to round it up to €7, that is perfectly fine.

				<p>
                    People are generally well behaved on public transport in the Netherlands. You will always have your bad eggs, of course, 
                    but a journey on a train, for example, is often relatively peaceful. This goes well with the fact the Dutch don't like
                    shouting in a public setting, so keep this in mind if travelling on public transport, especially in groups. Taking phone
                    calls is permitted on transport, but it is best to keep your voice down as much as you can.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the disabled. Trains and the metro can get crowded during peak
                    hours, so seating will be at a premium. Do the right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. You might even be
                    able to strike up a conversation with a local!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! - All public transport (with the exception of taxis) use the smart-card system called OV-Chipkaart.
                    This is a pre-pay card that you use to 'tap-in' when you enter the vehicle or station and 'tap-out' when you reach your 
                    destination. An OV-Chipkaart can be bought from any station and come in anonymous versions and personal versions, the latter 
                    of which can only be applied for online. Services like trams are quickly phasing out indivdual tickets, so be sure to pick yourself
                    up an OV card when you travel to the Netherlands. You can even get a single-use one for indivdual journeys, though they're
                    more expensive.
