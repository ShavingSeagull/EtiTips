                    While being one of the smallest countries in Europe, the Netherlands (or often just called Holland, even though that is
                    technically incorrect) has a rich history dating back many hundreds of years. Home to great artists such as van Gogh and
                    Rembrandt, the Netherlands is known for its liberal nature and easy-going people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The capital city is Amsterdam and the currency is the Euro (â‚¬).

                    While noted for their laid-back nature, the Dutch people can often be perceived by foreigners as being a little arrogant. 
                    This stems from the fact that they tend to be rather direct in conversation. If you want something in the Netherlands then
                    ask for it. The Dutch also tend not to shy away from their accomplishments, so it isn't unusual to hear people speak about
                    the things they perceive themselves to be good at. This may seem a little alien to you depending on where you come from, 
                    but if you want to blend in then don't be afraid to talk about yourself!
                </p>
                <p>...and you can do so in English! The Netherlands has the highest quantity of English speakers outside of English-speaking
                    countries in the world. Somewhat of a nuisance if you want to practice your Dutch because you'll likely be answered in 
                    English, but certainly handy if you don't know a lick of the local language.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Conducting yourself well in Dutch society is fairly easy. As long as you aren't hurting anybody, most won't care what you
                    are or what you do. There are obvious caveats to this, of course, but the common-sense approach towards respectability will
                    serve you well here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bonus tip! - if you want to make friends quickly in the Netherlands, have a beer or a smoke* with them.

				<p>
                    The generally liberal mindset of the Netherlands carries over into the field of love, too. Whether you are dating
                    a man or a woman (as a man or a woman), you'll find very little resistance from the local populace. The Netherlands
                    was the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage back in December 2000, so please bear this in mind
                    if your personal values differ from the local population. 
				</p>
				<p>
                    While not strictly 'love', the Netherlands is also somewhat famous for its Red Light Districts. Not the seedy career
                    it is perceived as elsewhere, the 'oldest profession in the world' is legal in certain areas of cities such as 
                    Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague (Den Haag), and is highly monitored. The workers are required to keep themselves 
                    in good health and are protected by the law. While not to everyone's tastes, if you do plan on frequenting the 
                    Red Light District, keep in mind that the local workers are to be treated as human beings and you are expected to behave
                    properly.

                <h3 class="section-header">Useful Words</h3>
                <p>
                        Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting the Netherlands. 
                        Learning a few could also help you make a good impression on the locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses ().
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>NB:</b> The letter 'G' in Dutch is pronounced with a gutteral use of the throat, similar to sounds found in Welsh or Hebrew. It
                    may sound unpleasant to say this, but the easiest way to explain how to pronounce it would be to imagine you are trying to hack up
                    phlegm from your throat. Sorry, that was as unpleasant to write as it was for you to read. If the sound is too hard to do, it is 
                    acceptable to soften the sound into a slightly gutteral 'H' sound and this is actually how a 'G' is pronounced in the Dutch speaking 
                    part of Belgium. We will write 'Gs' as 'hg' in the phonetic pronunciation below to remind you.
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>
                        <b>Goedemorgen</b> (hgooya-morhgen) - <i>Good morning/general greeting</i>. Use until noon. Note that the 'd' is pronounced like a 'y'. 
                        This is just a common adjustment Dutch people have made in this circumstance. You may also pronounce it as a 'd'.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Goededag</b> (hgooya-dahg) - <i>Good day/general greeting</i>. Used after noon until evening.</li>
                    <li><b>Goedenavond</b> (hgooya-nafond) - <i>Good evening/general greeting</i>. Used after the sun goes down.</li>
                    <li><b>Hallo</b> (hallo) - <i>Hello</i>. More informal than the above greetings, but acceptable to use in shops etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Hoi</b> (hoy) - <i>Hi</i>. Much more informal that the above greetings.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Dankuwel</b> (dahn-koo-well) - <i>Thank you</i>. The letter 'U' here makes it formal, but that would be appropriate if speaking
                        to someone you've just met.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Bedankt</b> (ber-dahnked) - <i>Thanks</i>. More informal than dankuwel, but acceptable in shops etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Alstublieft</b> (ahl-stoo-bleeft) - <i>Please</i>. Again, the 'U' makes it the formal version.</li>
                    <li><b>Tot Ziens</b> (tot zeens) - <i>Good bye</i>. Usuable all day.</li>
                    <li><b>Doei</b> (doo-ee) - <i>Bye</i>. Much more informal than tot ziens.</li>
                    <li><b>Ja</b> (yah) - <i>Yes</i>. Note how the 'J' is pronounced like a 'Y'.</li>
                    <li><b>Nee</b> (nay) - <i>No</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>Sorry</b> (sorry) - Yup, just like in English. The Dutch have taken to using sorry when doing something wrong.</li>
                    <li><b>Excuseer</b> (ex-coo-seer) - <i>Excuse me</i>. Useful when you want to pass by someone on the street.</li>
                </ul>

				<h4 class="section-header">Do's</h4>

					<li>Relax and be easy-going. The locals certainly will be</li>

                        Put aside your fears of not being understood. Virtually everybody in
                        the Netherlands speaks English as a second language
