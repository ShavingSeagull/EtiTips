                    The Netherlands may be small, but its history is long and its culture old. Dutch society is built around egalitarianism
                    and tolerance, though a healthy rivalry with the Germans and the Belgians remain, partly due to historical events and partly
                    due to neighbouring borders. The Netherlands is famous for a great many things and any time spent in the country will surely
                    prove to be eventful for entertainment seekers and cultural seekers alike.

                    The official language is Dutch and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Though the largest religion is Christianity, the majority of Dutch people are non-religious. A massive 50% of the population
                    declared themselves irreligious in government data from 2015, with Christianity (all denominations) at 43%. Owing to its
                    egalitarian nature, other faiths are present in the Netherlands, but religion as a whole is on the decline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dutch will cherish a good debate about religion, even though the majority of people don't follow one.
                    It can always be said that discussing religion should be done with tentative delicacy and that is no different here.
                    Though the majority are irreligious, you shouldn't expect to be looked down on if you are religious yourself. Providing
                    you keep your personal beliefs to yourself, the locals will pay you no mind.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    The general dress sense in the Netherlands is the same as anywhere else in the Western world: t-shirts, jeans, suits, shorts,
                    dresses, tanktops etc. There is no religious reason to cover oneself and no cultural stigma against wearing clothing
                    that leaves little to the imagination. The rule of thumb is that if you want to wear it, you can. That should make
                    your choice of outfits to put in your suitcase a bit easier!
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Dutch are known for their direct approach in conversation, even though they generally keep themselves to themselves
                    in public settings. You won't find it common for a Dutch stranger to speak to you on the street, though you won't receive
                    a raised eyebrow for being the first to engage, either. As mentioned on the Social tab, keep their direct nature in mind
                    when speaking to them. For a lot of other cultures, this can seem quite abrupt and therefore rude, but it certainly isn't
                    the case!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bicycles are a huge part of Dutch life and you'll see them everywhere. While bike lanes are common in a lot of countries
                    these days, it is most true in the Netherlands - they even have their own traffic lights! Bike lanes can be hard to 
                    distinguish for foreigners because they generally aren't painted with symbols. Rather, the paving tiles they use for bike
                    lanes will be a different colour to the rest of the pavement and it will be next to the road, so take care when exiting a
                    parked car - you will hear the chiming of bicycle bells if you stand in the bike lane for more than a moment!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many tourists go to the Netherlands for the entertainment - namely marijuana. While marijuana can be smoked without fear
                    of reprimand and bought openly in 'Coffee Shops', advertising for it is still illegal. Therefore, if you wish to visit a
                    coffee shop and partake, you will need to ask to see the menu. From there, the shop clerk can guide you as to what to buy.
                    An important distinction has to be made between 'Coffee Shop' and 'Café'. While in English the two can be synonymous, in
                    Dutch they are worlds apart - Coffee Shops serve marijuana (and drinks/food), whereas Cafés function as regular cafés. Take
                    very special care in using the right word if asking a Dutch person about where the local place to get a coffee is!

                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Even though the Dutch are famed for their laid-back nature, professional life in the Netherlands is taken as seriously
                    as anywhere else. Businesses are profit oriented and the capitalist free-market model functions openly here. The Netherlands
                    does, however, enjoy a very high work-to-private life ratio. It is very much the case that once the shift is over, the work
                    day is done. Businessmen will not expect to entertain clients outside of working hours, nor will they likely make an exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some parts of the world, the customer is always right. In the Netherlands, the person who is right is the person who is right.
                    Companies will not bend over backwards to please a difficult client who is mkaing poor decisions - the client will be told in no
                    uncertain terms why they are being disagreed with. This practice stems from the egalitarian nature of the culture and, likewise,
                    company directors are not put on a high pedestal, either. Members of management will be expected to get their own coffee, photocopy
                    their own papers and speak to their underlings instead of ignoring them. This can be in stark contrast to even other Western nations, 
                    so do keep this in mind if working in a Dutch company or with Dutch people.
