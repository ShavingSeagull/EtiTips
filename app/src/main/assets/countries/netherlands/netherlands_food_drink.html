                    Like most Western countries, the Netherlands has a large selection of foreign cuisine available at short distance.
                    That being the case, the Dutch do have particular tastes when it comes to food. Their love for salt is quite famous,
                    so expect a lot of dishes to have a bit of extra kick! They are also the largest cheese exporter in the world, so if
                    you are a cheese fan, be sure to give it a try!

                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Haring (Raw herring) and Poffertjes (pancake snack).

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tipping culture in the Netherlands is quite absent. Not even usual tipping suspects, such as restaurants, expect
                    customers to tip the wait staff, so don't feel that you have to at all. It is worth noting that a 15% service charge is usually
                    applied to the bill, hence the lack of requirement to tip. If your service was particularly good, you can round up the bill or
                    leave the change, but be sure to give it to the waiter directly because...
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...tips don't always go to the waiters! In some establishments, the tips are given to the kitchen staff instead, so if you want
                    to tip your waiter, find out if he/she will actually receive it first and, if they do, hand it to them directly. As mentioned,
                    tipping is not common, there is almost always a service charge and the staff are typically paid fairly well, so it's best to tip
                    only for exemplary service.

                <p>
                    Again, tipping isn't expected in pubs or bars at all in the Netherlands. You may see a tip jar on the counter, but there is no
                    expectation to use it. If you have received great service or just wish to gid rid of your spare change before returning home, it
                    could be a nice gesture to drop a few coins in the tip jar, but otherwise it is safe to just pay for your drinks and leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The same rule applies when eating at a pub, too. There will likely be a service charge already included, so don't worry about the tip!

                </p>
                <p>
                    Cafés follow the same rule as restaurants when it comes to tipping. Typically you won't need to leave anything, but if you 
                    received particularly good service, you can leave the change behind from your bill. Tipping is certainly more of a kind gesture
                    than a means to pay wait staff's wages here, so a few cents will suffice if you feel the need to leave something.

                <p>
                    When toasting in the Netherlands, the word to use is "Proost!" (pronounced "Prohst" - O as in "oh"). It is important to keep
                    eye contact with those you are toasting with, don't look at your glass if clinking.

                <p>
                    The famous phrase 'going Dutch' when splitting the bill obviously originates from the Dutch culture of paying for oneself.
                    If you are a guest and will be paid for, the host will make it very clear. If they don't, expect to have to pay for yourself,
                    even when invited out by somebody else!

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in the Netherlands, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Keep your hands on the table when eating and your elbows off</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>Use your cultery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Be mindful of your language when eating in public venues. There are likely to be children around you</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to wait to be seated. They may have a seating plan in mind for a proper dinner function
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Again, in somebody's home, it is polite to wait for the host to begin eating before you do.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It is wise to take a smaller portion for yourself to begin with because you will likely be offered seconds.
                        It is polite to accept the extra serving, so save space for yourself!
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

				<h4 class="section-header">Do's</h4>

					<li>Wait for your host to begin eating before you do</li>
