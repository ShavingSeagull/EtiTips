                    China holds a number of illustrious titles. Not only is it the oldest continuously surviving civilisation with 3,500 years of written history 
                    (not counting the unwritten history before that), but in the present day it is the most populous nation on the planet, with 1.5 billion people. 
                    With such an old civilisation, it is perhaps unsurprising that China has had one of the most major impacts on development in all of human history, 
                    with many, many concepts and inventions being born of Chinese minds. This, coupled with their famed philosphers, makes the country a must-see for 
                    history fans and tourists alike.

				<p>
                    For many Westerners, China would be viewed as 'traditional' in the sense that the West used to hold similar values which have sinced changed. One of 
                    these concepts is that of 'honour', but since the word is more synonymous with Japan, we'll instead change it to 'respect'. Chinese behaviour is dictated, 
                    at least in part, by this concept of respect and not losing face, so to speak. It is for this reason that it is very unlikely for a local to do or say something 
                    that would make you look foolish or unfavoured in public. Likewise, you should do the same! To discredit someone in public in China would be a major faux-pas and 
                    highly disrespectful. This goes hand-in-hand with remaining calm in almost any situation, another concept the Chinese have mastered over their many years of societal 
                    existence. No matter what the issue is, whether something has gone awry or the language barrier is proving very frustrating in a difficult situation (which is understandable), 
                    you should always make an effort to remain calm and deal with things in a collected manner - your local counterparts certainly will and won't appreciate it whatsoever if you 
                    make a scene or a spectacle of yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another thing to point out here - and this will be especially true for Westerners - is that the concept of social grace differs in China than it does elsewhere. The type of 
                    behaviour you are used to at home will likely not apply here, which can cause some distress or even leave an impression that the locals are rude. This is understandable 
                    of course, but do keep in mind that people and societies are different around the World. A good example of what we mean by this would be being told that the present you 
                    bought isn't up to par! In virtually all Western societies, saying such a thing would be absolutely unfathomable, even to the point of destroying a relationship; this is, however, something 
                    that can happen owing to the Chinese nature of very direct speaking. The general rule is that if they are thinking it, they'll likely say it, so please bear this in mind 
                    when socialising with Chinese friends or locals. Likewise, many foreigners in mainland China of all shapes and colours will find some locals taking photographs of them 
                    without consent or even touching their hair if it happens to be curly. Again, this would be absolutely out of the question in many other cultures, but will be seen quite often in 
                    China. With this particular example, however, it stems from an innocent place - owing to the censorship imposed by the communist government, many people - especially those from more 
                    rural areas - have never seen a foreigner in the flesh before. Those with vastly different apprearances from the locals, such as dark skin, curly or light hair, will illicit a fascinated 
                    response, which results in the aforementioned behaviour of picture-taking and wonder. It will likely be an alien concept to you, but it's best to go along 
                    with it and follow the principle mentioned above of not making a scene.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of people assume that greetings in China involve bowing, but this isn't really the case. The oriental concept of bowing exists far more in Japan than China, so leading 
                    with a handshake and a smile is more appropriate. Do note, however, that a handshake in China should be kept light and weaker than would be expected elsewhere in the world. 
                    It isn't just personal preference - a strong handshake here is perceived as aggressive, so it's best to follow the local protocol.

                    A note on English speaking: it is fair to say that most people in mainland China don't speak English. Naturally, with each passing generation, the youth become more 
                    and more interested in speaking the world's lingua franca, but the overall standard is still very broken. Hotel staff will speak English to an acceptable 
                    standard, as would be expected, but don't expect the man on the street to understand what you're saying unless you're lucky. If you know any Mandarin, even some 
                    simple words (like the ones listed below), you'll manage to get by and make a good impression at the same time.

                    Dating in China is a far more serious affair than in the West. People (women in particular) are under a lot of pressure to find a marriage partner before they reach a certain age. 
                    The family plays a much more involved role in relationships here, too, meaning that if the family disapproves of you, the relationship is likely doomed. General attitudes 
                    toward sex are more traditional, too, with many Chinese men saying they would prefer a wife who hasn't engaged in premarital sex.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for couples coming to China on holiday, the rules are pretty simple - keep those hands and lips where we can see them! Couples falling over each other at every given 
                    opportunity will not be looked on favourably whatsoever, so keep private moments to private places. A note has to be made for same-sex couples: homosexuality is legal in 
                    China these days, but the attitude toward it is still rather negative. It would be very wise indeed, even more so than for heterosexual couples, to keep all shows of 
                    affection confined to a private place.

                <h3 class="section-header">Useful Words</h3>
                <p>
                        Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting China. There are many different dialects and some of those, 
                        such as Cantonese, are major languages within the country. The examples below, however, will focus on Mandarin, as this is the preferred national language. 
                        Learning a few could also help you make a good impression on the locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses ().

                    <li><b>早上好</b> (zao-shahng hao) - <i>Good morning</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>晚上好</b> (wan-shahng hao) - <i>Good evening</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>非常谢谢</b> (fay-chahng sheh-sheh) - <i>Thank you very much</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>谢谢</b> (sheh-sheh) - <i>Thanks</i>. More informal than the above, but acceptable in most occasions.</li>
                    <li><b>请你</b> (ching nee) - <i>Please</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>你好</b> (nee-hao) - <i>Hello</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>再见</b> (zai-jen) - <i>Goodbye</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>Bye bye</b> (bye bye) - <i>Bye</i>. A lot of Chinese have adopted the English phrase "bye bye", so you can actually use that, too! Just make sure you say it twice instead of once, as we usually would in English.</li>
                    <li><b>是的</b> (sheh-da) - <i>Yes</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>不是</b> (bu-sheh) - <i>No</i>.</li>
