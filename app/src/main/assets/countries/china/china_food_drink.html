                    Chinese cuisine is one of the most famous in the world, with its various dishes and delicacies being a favourite in virtually every Western country, as well as others 
                    further afield. Known for its flavour and moreishness, the range of dishes has grown to incorporate some neighbouring delicacies, such as those from Singapore, 
                    Thailand and Vietnam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Dim Sum (small steamed portions of various food) and Hot Pot (various food self-cooked in a fondue style pot)

                <h3 class="section-header">Tipping</h3>
                <p>
                    The general rule in China is that you don't tip for anything. Many establishments will refuse a tip and the practice actually remains illegal in some parts of the country. 
                    So, don't try to "be nice and leave something anyway", because it will very likely backfire or could even result in somebody losing their job if they accept the tip. These 
                    days, owing to increased tourism etc, some high-end establishments will include a service charge, but we'll make note of that below. The general rule-of-thumb, though, is that 
                    you don't tip!
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...with exceptions for tour guides! It's never totally straight forward, is it? Tour guides are the sole exception to the rule in that they absolutely will expect a tip. The 
                    reason for this is that they rely on the money for the bulk of their income. Unless it's a private tour, around $10 per person in your group will suffice.

                <p>
                    As mentioned above, no tipping is expected in restaurants and many will refuse the offer outright. Some upper class establishments may include a 10-15% service charge, however, 
                    so be aware of that if dining in such a venue.

                <hr class="line" style="width: 130px;"/>
                <p>
                    When toasting in China, the word to use is "干杯!" (pronounced "Gan-bey!"). Beware! Toasting in China is serious business and has the opportunity 
                    to leave you on the floor very quickly. <i>Everytime</i> someone toasts, you are expected to finish your glass! For this reason, it is very wise to 
                    opt for beer rather than spirits, as it's weaker and will give you more longevity. If you are fortunate enough to hear "Ban-bey", be very relieved - 
                    this version of toasting means you only have to drink half your glass.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drinking culture among friends and colleagues is a big thing in China and there is a certain etiquette involved (though it is all taken in good jest). 
                    Either be all-in or all-out - you can't expect to participate in toasts and drinking games when you feel like it. If you participate, be prepared for a headache 
                    the next day, though. If you wish to avoid the heavy drinking involved in such situations, you can 'save face' by fabricating an excuse, such as a Doctor's 
                    orders, a certain medication or religious reasons why you can't drink at all. Naturally, pregnant women will never be asked to particpate and women in 
                    general will get an easier pass for excusing themselves from the festivites than men. A final word of warning - if you take part in the Chinese drinking culture, 
                    you better be prepared to win. Being forced to duck-out early will result in major friendly ribbing from those around you, as will refusing to take part 
                    altogether. Having the ability to laugh at yourself will be absolutely essential in this scenario!
                </p>
                <h3 class="paragraph-header"><img src="file:///android_res/drawable/cash_icon.png" width="40px" height="25px"/> The Bill</h3>
                <hr class="line" style="width: 130px;"/>
                <p>
                    The Chinese have a rather set cultural precedent for paying for guests. When you're in China on holiday, you are a guest and so any 
                    local friends you may have will likely pay for dinner along with a lot of other things. It is considered rude to attempt to pay for yourself 
                    after it has been established that your Chinese friend will pay the entire bill - simply thank them for the meal and comment on how 
                    delicious it was. Likewise, however, if you end up hosting any Chinese friends in your country, they will expect you to pay for nearly 
                    everything as well!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If nobody has offered to pay the bill before the evening begins, expect a wrestling session to break out when the bill arrives. The concept of 'face' 
                    dictates that every man at the table should try to pay the bill, though obviously many will hold silent reservations in their minds. If you really want to 
                    pay, keep the bill and say things such as "Allow me the honour" or "You can get the next one". If you would rather not pay, still offer, but give up after 
                    insisting once or twice. Be aware that it may backfire and you could end up saddled with the bill!

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in China, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Remember to take off your shoes when entering somebody's house!</li>
                    <li>Dishes are served in large communal bowls or plates that everybody takes from</li>
                    <li>Seniority dictates who starts the meal off and this is usually the eldest person at the table. Never begin eating until the guest of honour has started.</li>
                    <li>
                        China largely uses chopsticks (though decent restaurants will stock western cutlery, too), but there is an etiquette to handling them. Never leave them 
                        pointing up in a bowl of food as this is a custom involved with funerals. When talking at the dinner table, it is good practice to place your chopsticks 
                        on the chopstick stand next to your plate. Don't use them to point while you're talking
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unlike in the West, where bringing your crockery to your mouth is extremely bad manners, in China it is expected for smaller bowls, such as rice bowls. 
                        It can greatly aid in not spilling food, especially when using chopsticks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slurping when eating noodles or soup isn't considered bad manners at all; in fact, it shows you are enjoying the food! Again, bringing the bowl to your mouth as 
                        you eat will be the usual practice
                    </li>
                    <li>Small burps while eating is actually a sign of appreciation for the food. This is in stark contrast to most other countries</li>
                    <li>Don't eat directly from communal plates. Use the serving spoon or utensil provided to place some of the food onto your plate</li>
                    <li>Likewise, don't take the last portion from the communal dish unless it is offered to you</li>
                    <li>The faster you finish your food, the faster your plate will be refilled. If you are full, it is best to leave a little food to show you can't eat anymore</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of western cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to wait to be seated. They will likely have a seating plan in mind, which will involve the elders being in the most prominent place</li>
                    <li>It is good manners to bring a small gift if eating at somebody's home. Special expensive teas or a good quality liquor work well</li>
                </ul>

				<h4 class="section-header">Do's</h4>

					<li>Wait for the guest of honour (usually the elder) to start eating first</li>

                        practices can be quite vast sometimes
