                    When we say Chinese culture is old, we're making a rather vast understatement. In reality, it's truly ancient and has undergone several 
                    shifts over the thousands of years it has held a place in the World. Once a culture that shut itself away behind giant walls, modern day China 
                    has since adopted some Western approaches to things, while also being fervent maintainers of their ancient past and customs.

                    The official language is Mandarin and the national faith is Chinese Folk Religion.

                <p>
                    Though the national religion is technically the traditional Chinese Folk Religion, the vast majority of Chinese people officially 
                    identify as irreligious; the state is also fiercly atheist. It tends to be the case that the native people hold an affiliation to the traditional faith without recognising 
                    it in a formal format, such as on a census. Buddhism is also present in a fairly large capacity in China and it isn't uncommon to find people 
                    practising the local folk religion and Buddhism side-by-side. Despite Western influence over the years, Christianity remains a minority religion in China.

                    Conducting yourself well in Chinese society with regards to religion is certainly easier than some other countries, owing 
                    to the largely irreligious population. Whether you believe in something or not, few people will take much notice here. That 
                    said, it would be wise not to try and push your beliefs on the local people, as this would come across as very rude. You may 
                    also fall foul of the law, who does protect religious freedom in the constitution, but is also staunchly atheist and likes to come 
                    down hard on religious groups not given the green light by the government. It's best not to give the authorities any excuse to 
                    persecute you.

                    The general dress sense in modern China outside of festival times is fairly Westernised, though the people like to maintain a smart appearance, especially when going 
                    out for dinner etc. Appearance is part of the 'Face' system used in Chinese society, so making sure you always look respectable will go a long 
                    way to having others hold you in higher regard, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business dress is dark and conservative. The key is to try and blend in with your co-workers, so nothing flashy, which includes 
                    an abundance of jewellery. Dark suits are definitely the way to go and make sure it fits you well. Ladies should also adhere to a 
                    conservative dress sense, with pant suits being a good choice.

                <p>
                    In China, family is everything. There are many countries that follow this approach, with much of the Middle East and the Latin countries of 
                    Europe and South America also placing huge importance on the family unit. Folks from the West would likely describe the typical Chinese family unit 
                    as 'traditional', though all this means in reality is that they operate the same way Western families did a few decades ago. In practice, this means 
                    the father will go out to work hard to provide for his family, while the mother will maintain the house and raise the children. It is sometimes the case 
                    that the mothers will have to work, too, though it is the desire of every Chinese man to be in a position where he can provide for his family alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also a part of the family unit are elders, who will typically live with their families. In fact, it's normal to see three generations living under one roof in 
                    China! Elders are hugely, hugely respected here and it is <b>never</b> a good idea to do or say anything that would cause offence or embarrassment for an older 
                    person. They start eating first, they enter rooms first and they take pole position at any important event, bar a wedding of course. If you are in a 
                    relationship with a local and wish to make a good impression on their families, do everything you can to show respect to the elders. Actions speak louder than 
                    words, especially in Oriental cultures, so don't let the language barrier stop you.

                    Anybody who has tuned into the news at any point since 1949 will be aware of the communist revolution that swept China. We hear enough of the horror stories from 
                    outside China to put us off going anywhere near the country, but don't let that stop you. While it certainly is true that censorship and authoritarianism have a strong 
                    grip on China, providing you do nothing untoward you'll have nothing to fear when you visit here - China doesn't behave like North Korea, where foreigners are accused of 
                    being spies and locked away for twenty years. Just be sensible and remember that you are in the presence of an overbearing state authority, so be sure to behave yourself 
                    and conduct yourself well and you'll have no issue whatsoever - the powers-that-be only step in when their authority is threatened.

                    Doing business in China involves strict protocol that you will absolutely need to adhere to in order to be successful. Luckily, we will cover all the major areas of business 
                    etiquette here, so have no fear!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's start at the beginning - entering the meeting room. Yes, there is even protocol for that. Business in China is strictly hierarchical, meaning the senior ranking employee 
                    has the most authority. This translates into physicality, too, in the sense that when your Chinese counterparts enter the room, they will do so in order of seniority - the head 
                    of the delgation will enter first, followed by his number two etc. It is important for you to follow suit and do the same, as this shows them exactly who the one in charge is; also follow 
                    this protocol when leaving the room and always allow your counterparts to leave first. Next we have greetings. Sometimes, especially when dealing with very senior employees, a small bow will 
                    be necessary, though these days the common handshake is becoming the preferred choice. Remember to keep the handshake fairly light, as a crushing grip implies aggression. Always let your Chinese 
                    counterpart initiate the handshake, however! Following the greeting will likely be the exchange of business cards, which still have great importance in Oriental countries. You should always accept 
                    the card with two hands and be sure to study it for a moment. As for your own cards, it would be extremely wise to have special ones printed in Mandarin on one side and English on the other. In 
                    regards of design, gold is the colour of prestige and wealth, so consider having your Chinese business cards printed with some gold on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meetings will always start with some small-talk and this is actually considered an important part of the process, so be sure to engage in it. The Chinese like to do business with people they 
                    have some knowledge of, hence why they like to try and get a glimpse of your personality beforehand. Good topics to discuss are family, interests, the weather and interesting locations. You 
                    will set a good impression if you comment positively on things you have experienced while in China - either places, food or festival events will work well. On the contrary, there are some topics 
                    which should <b>never</b> be brought up and these are politics, human rights, Tibet and Taiwan. All of these areas are very sensitive subjects in China, so if you wish for your meeting to go well, 
                    just steer clear of them altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we mentioned on the Social tab, the Chinese like to maintain an air of calm in all situations, so it's best not to show too much emotion during a meeting, either positive or negative. Don't worry, 
                    smiling is allowed, but hold back from getting too passionate about your proposal or becoming agitated if things aren't going the way you would like. Partnered with this is the Chinese system of 'Face' 
                    we have mentioned numerous times already. Pay very close attention: do not, under any circumstance, say anything that would cause your counterpart, or anyone in the room for that matter, to lose 'face'. 
                    We can't stress this enough. This also includes saying "no", which shows a flat-out refusal for something they have suggested, thus resulting in them losing 'face' with their colleagues. If you wish to 
                    disagree - and your Chinese counterparts will do the same, too - use phrases such as "Please allow me more time to think about that" or "That may be possible". This is equivalent to when we say "Maybe" 
                    in English, but actually mean no. Do bear in mind as well, that if your counterpart says something along those lines to you, the answer is actually no. Likewise, if they say "That won't be a big problem", 
                    you can safely assume that it is a huge problem. Always, always keep the concept of maintaining 'face' in mind, both for your side of the negotiation and theirs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time keeping is an important concept in China, so do be sure to arrive when you are supposed to. It would also be a very wise idea to schedule an interpreter to be present, as most Chinese speak very broken 
                    levels of English. Take note of where you are when arranging an interpreter - for most of mainland China, Mandarin will be the language you'll need. In the Guangzhou region in the south or in places like 
                    Hong Kong and Macau, you will need an interpreter who speaks Cantonese. As for gift giving, that's easy - don't. Most times this is seen as bribery, so it's best avoided altogether, <b>especially</b> if you're 
                    dealing with anybody from the government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, a word on alcohol. We mentioned the drinking culture over on the Food &amp; Drink tab, but this can often come into business meetings, too. You will need to be very aware of the culture surrounding 
                    alcohol, as it also ties in with respect and the concept of 'Face'. If you agree to drink with your counterparts, be prepared for an extremely heavy night - you will be expected to keep up with your counterparts 
                    drink-for-drink and may even have to take the company's desginated Drinking Representative on in a drinking contest (yes, that's actaully a thing). If you wish to steer clear of it or if you actually have to for any reason, blaming a 
                    medical condition works very well and won't be argued. Ladies typically won't have this problem, as the drinking culture centers around men.
