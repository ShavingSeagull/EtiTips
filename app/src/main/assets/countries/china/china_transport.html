                    China has a decent public transport network, with bus, rail, air and metro being options. The buses, while very cheap and 
                    fairly reliable, aren't overly advised for foreigners as everything is in Chinese, aside from in the big cities, which will give 
                    out the destinations in English, too. Rail is a very popular option and the metro systems are providing an increasingly 
                    unbeatable standard of travel in China, though they only exist in the largest cities.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with every other service in the country, tipping is not required in China and should be actively avoided for the reasons 
                    stated over on the Food &amp; Drink tab. Good service is expected in the price you pay for the fare, so any extra is totally 
                    unnecessary and can actually be seen as an insult.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bonus tip for taxis! Virtually none of the drivers speak English, so be sure to have your destination written down in Chinese 
                    characters. Taxis are very cheap and a great way for foreigners to get around. They are also fairly straight-edge and typically 
                    won't try to rip tourists off. Their licenses are strictly goverened by the authorities, so it just isn't worth it to them to lose 
                    their livelihoods over a few extra Yuan.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour on Chinese public transport are decent enough, with the typical daily behaviour of people reflected when they 
                    use transport, too. Be wary of very busy buses in big cities as pickpockets aren't unheard of, though they're not a huge problem either. 
                    If you want to avoid working up a sweat (or indulging in the odour of others who do), look for buses with a snowflake logo on them - this 
                    signifies it's air conditioned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to give up your seat to somebody vulnerable, such as the elderly or the disabled. Given how respected elders are in Chinese society, 
                    you will be setting a massively positive example by doing so. Remember that you are representing your country when you go abroad, so be sure to 
                    conduct yourself properly, as it will not only make your time in China easier, but also those who follow you.
                </p>

				<h4 class="section-header">Do's</h4>
				<ul class="good-list">
					<li>
                        Book the 'soft seat' option on train journeys under 6 hours or the 'soft bed' option for journeys over 6 hours. The 'hard seat' option can 
                        result in you not actually getting a seat at all, which could be disastrous if you have to stand on a crowded, sweaty train for 6 hours!
                    </li>

					<li>Give up your seat for somebody vulnerable</li>
