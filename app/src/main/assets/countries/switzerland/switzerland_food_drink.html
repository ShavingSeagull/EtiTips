                    Swiss food is a hodgepodge of German, French and Italian inspired dishes, but don't let this fool you into thinking that the 
                    country doesn't have specialities of its own! Cheese fondue is revered here, with tourists and locals alike indulging in its 
                    rich, warm taste. As with most of the rest of Europe, you can also find foreign food, such as Indian and Chinese, with 
                    restaurants available in most places.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Cheese Fondue (bread dipped in pots of hot cheese) and Rösti (fried potato patties).

                    Tipping in Switzerland isn't a straightforward practice. On the one hand, there is a service charge applied to almost everything here 
                    and servers earn a decent wage for the work they do, so tipping isn't necessary. On the other, it isn't unusual to find Swiss people 
                    leaving something extra on top of the service charge if the service was excellent. It really comes down to you. If you feel the service 
                    warrants it, you may leave a little extra; if the service was nothing to write home about, it is acceptable to leave nothing as well. 
                    If you do wish to leave something on top of the service charge, a Franc or two will definitely suffice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be aware that your waiter won't always receive the tip if you have paid by card, so always ensure you leave the tip in cash! A good way 
                    to do this if you have paid the bill by cash is to tell the waiter how much change you want back. For example, if your bill is CHF 15.50 
                    and you pay with CHF 20, you could say "Just give me 3 Francs change, please", thus leaving a tip of CHF 1.50.

                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in Switzerland isn't really expected. You can always round up the bill or drop some coins into the tip jar 
                    if you wish, but it isn't an expected custom. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, if you are receiving table service, tipping would be a good idea. In the event you are drinking in an
                    establishment with table service, leaving a few Francs on top of the bill will suffice. Somewhere in the region of CHF 1-3.

                    Tipping in cafés in Switzerland isn't expected, so don't feel the need to leave something. Naturally, if you were lucky
                    enough to have the world's best service, then feel free to leave a little something if you wish, but that is entirely
                    up to you. If you feel the need to give something, simply rounding up the bill to the next Franc or dropping a few coins 
                    in the tip jar will definitely suffice. As with everything else here, there will be a service charge already applied to your bill.

                    When toasting in Switzerland, the word to use is "Proscht!" (the 'O' is pronounced as the 'O' in 'top'). 
                    If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass. Toasting is a popular past-time, so it
                    would be a good idea to learn the local word!

                <p>
                    Today, it is very common to see groups of friends split the bill in a restaurant, with each person paying for what they ordered. 
                    Older people will usually pay for the table, but amongst the younger generations this is unlikely. Wait staff are more than happy 
                    to accomodate splitting the bill, partly due to the fact that a group of people leaving individual tips amounts to more than a group 
                    tip!

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Switzerland, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>After you take your seat, wait for the host or someone to say "Guten Appetit!" or "Bon Appetit!"(enjoy your meal). It is rude to begin eating beforehand.</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands above the table, but your elbows off while seated, not just while eating</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>Use your cultery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>Break bread with your hands, don't cut it with a knife</li>
                    <li>Everything is eaten with cutlery, even fruit</li>
                    <li>Be sure not to leave food on your plate, it is considered impolite. If you are serving yourself, take only what you know you can finish</li>
                    <li>When you are finished eating, leave your knife and fork parallel at clock positions 5:25 on your plate, otherwise your host will serve you more food</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to bring a small gift. Either good quality chocolates or flowers (not red roses) work well. Be sure not to bring 
                        something large and extravagant as this is seen as boastful and considered impolite
                    </li>
