                    Swiss culture is renowned for breeding stoic people who favour sensibility, non-conflict and good manners. With 
                    famous names such as Carl Jung, Leonhard Euler and Roger Federer hailing from Switzerland, it is certainly the case that the 
                    country's small size certainly doesn't reflect its ability to produce exceptional people. The naturally mountainous 
                    landscape proves very popular with winter sport enthusiasts, with skiing and snowboarding ranking among some of the 
                    main reasons people travel to Switzerland. Oh, it's also home to the Alps. But it's not like they're famous or anything...

                    The official languages are German, French, Italian &amp; Romansh and the national religion is Christianity.

                <h3 class="section-header">Religion</h3>
                <p>
                    Though Christianity isn't the official religion of the state (it has none), Christians make up 68% of the population (75% if you 
                    only include Swiss citizens), with this divided heavily between Roman Catholicism and the Swiss Reformed Church. Irreligious folk 
                    are the second largest group at 24%, showing a clear trend in favour of religious identity, which, interestingly, differs hugely 
                    from neighbouring Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While talking about religion is generally an unwise idea, you'll likely find someone willing to press the issue here, especially 
                    in the northern part bordering Germany. Bear in mind, however, that the Swiss are generally traditional and conservative minded, so 
                    it would be wise to keep any discussion about religion very respectful, especially if you don't follow the local belief system. 
                    Coming into any discussion guns blazing would be disastrous.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    The general dress sense is a little more reserved than elsewhere in the Western world. While dress sense will be fairly 
                    similar here, it is wise to err on the side of caution rather than making a spectacle of yourself. There is room for 
                    individual style, of course, but it's best to be sensible about what you wear. No flashy colours or underwear hanging 
                    out of your jeans! The Swiss favour darker colours, so if you wish to blend in, pack your darker-shade-of-black turtleneck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you plan on visiting the higher altitude places (and let's be honest, how could you not? Grindelwald in the winter, just...wow), 
                    be sure to pack some extra layers and a coat. The summers in Switzerland can get blisteringly hot, but the temperature can change 
                    on a dime, especially when travelling around and through various altitudes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dress in the workplace is important in Switzerland. As with most places, corporate life is dominated by smart dress, with dark shades 
                    of suit for men and either suits or dresses for women. A nice pair of shoes will certainly get you noticed for the right reasons, too.

                <p>
                    The Swiss are known for their considered approach to almost everything. Having good manners and proper social etiquette is of paramount 
                    importance here as even the children will behave with utmost respect, so it's a good thing you've found yourself on this app! You may find 
                    the Swiss difficult to get to know initially, as they prefer to spend their time being productive rather than making conversation with those 
                    they don't know. That being said, while it may take a little extra time to earn a Swiss person's friendship, if you do so, you will likely 
                    have a friend for life as they take the relationship very seriously.

                <p>
                    Time keeping is huge in neighbouring Germany and it is rather prevalent in Switzerland, too. If you agree to meet someone for 
                    something, it is wise to ensure you arrive on time. A minute or two will be excused, but anything more will require a solid 
                    reason, delivered in advance. For people from places like Italy or Spain, where being late is almost a profession in itself, 
                    the strict time keeping may take some getting used to!

                    For the country's many positives, some people have expressed disdain with what they consider a boring and invasive society. As 
                    mentioned before, the general mantra here is one of traditionalism and conservatism, so it is perhaps obvious why this may prove 
                    difficult for some people to follow. If you are looking to relocate to a new country and favour a society that turns a blind eye 
                    to almost anything, Switzerland may not be the place for you. However, if you place value in a culture that favours and rewards 
                    hard work and dedication, you may just find this to be one of the best options.

                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Work life in Switzerland will vary from area to area, depending on which neighbouring culture is dominant. In the majority of the country, 
                    where the culture borrows more from Germany, you can expect a working life predicated on hard work and a clear line between office relationships 
                    and personal ones. On the contrary, find yourself working in an area closer to the Italian border and the attitude can change entirely. If you 
                    find yourself working or conducting business in Switzerland, definitely take a look at the closest neighbouring country here on EtiTips to gain 
                    an idea of what to expect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though times are slowly changing, formality is still king in Switzerland. It is not uncommon for colleagues who have sat across from each other
                    for years, still refer to each other as Mr X and Ms Y. This can be common tripping ground for foreigners working here, especially when
                    they begin learning German (or Swiss-German) and encounter the Sie vs Du conundrum (both meaning 'you' - Sie is formal, Du is informal). This, along with the
                    separation of work and pleasure mentioned above, leads to much less socialising at work and, most notably, after work. Don't expect to be
                    invited for a beer after hours on a Friday unless it is a special occasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meetings and appointments are also shrouded in formality. Unlike neighbouring Italy and France, where a meeting has the potential to be more personal, 
                    especially during the first encounter, in Switzerland you can expect nothing of the sort. Here, professionalism is king, so be sure to bring your A-game. 
                    If you are conducting business, don't worry about bringing a gift, as this just isn't part of professional custom here. It may become appropriate once a 
                    successful negotiation has completed, but certainly not before. Business can be conducted over a meal, so be willing to talk business over a pot of fondue 
                    at the local restaurant.
