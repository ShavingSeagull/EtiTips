                    A nation famed for its breathtaking landscape and impressive mountain ranges, Switzerland is a hiker's and 
                    artist's paradise in equal measure. The country is unusual in that it is a natural combination of multiple cultures and 
                    languages, having Germany, France, Austria and Italy as neighbours. Whether you come for the chocolate, the skiing or 
                    for business, you are certain to never forget this idyllic nation.

					The capital city is Bern and the currency is the Swiss Franc (<i>Fr.</i> or CHF).

                    The Swiss often get lumped in with the Germans and this is perhaps no surprise - over 60% of Swiss people speak German 
                    (or the Swiss dialect of German), vastly more than any of the other main languages, French, Italian and Romansh. The general 
                    nature of this majority can often resemble the nature of the Germans, too, with some of the stereotypes proving true for 
                    both nationalities. Naturally, this isn't true for all Swiss and, certainly, the further south-west you go, the more French 
                    the people become in attitude.

                    To conduct oneself well in Switzerland, it is important to keep a level head as they do. You will get nowhere if you act
                    boistrously or rudely. Shouting in the street should absolutely be avoided and keeping a good degree of social grace
                    would be a wise idea. Be sure to speak politely (always say please and thank you), but directly - the Swiss aren't known for beating 
                    around the bush. The people here are big on proper greetings, so be sure to shake hands with everyone you are introduced to, if you 
                    find yourself in such a scenario. For friends, a handshake between men is appropriate and for two women or a man and a women, air 
                    kisses on the cheeks are expected - three of them, in fact, starting with the right. It is fairly common to be greeted by shop staff 
                    and you will be expected to return the gesture, so check out the common words section below for some handy things to make you stand 
                    out in the right way!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Swiss aren't the most outgoing bunch, so don't expect idle chitchat with strangers on the street. It's also worth noting that 
                    the direct manner of the language here makes some typical topics for small-talk in English a bit redundant. For example, we often 
                    say "How are you?" when we meet someone in English and this is seen as largely rhetorical - reply with anything besides "Fine, thanks" 
                    and you'll probably draw eyerolls. However, in Switzerland such a question would be taken seriously and answered seriously, so do bear 
                    this in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, a note on the Swiss people's famed love of privacy: it's very true that people prefer to keep their cards close to their 
                    chest here. When you meet someone for the first time, regardless of the setting, don't ask probing questions! This is seen as 
                    highly rude and will cause the worst first impression you could hope for. In some cultures, such as in America, telling your life 
                    story to a stranger can be rather common, but you should absolutely refrain from that in Switzerland.

                    The attitude to romance in Switzerland will vary as much as the culture does, honestly. Find yourself in the north, where the strong  
                    German influence is and you'll find the more German approach of no displays of affection and and a more...stoic...take on dating to be 
                    more prevalent. Go further south toward either the French or Italian border and you'll find a more liberal attitude in line with the 
                    neighbouring country. Seeing as Switzerland is a conservative minded nation, however, it would probably be wise to err on the side 
                    of caution when visiting with a loved one. Keep private matters to a private setting.

                    Despite the naturally conservative nature of the people, same-sex relationships are legal in Switzerland and same-sex marriage is soon 
                    to be passed into law, so please bear this in mind if your personal views differ from the local population's. As with the attitude toward 
                    public displays of affection, the Swiss aren't bothered what you do in your private life as long as you keep it to yourself. That being said, 
                    people in relationships of any nature should find little resistance from the native people, providing you conduct yourself properly.

                <h3 class="section-header">Useful Words</h3>
                <p>
                    Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting Switzerland. Note, that there 
                    are four official languages in Switzerland, but Swiss-German is by far the most common, so that is what is listed below. Also note, Swiss-German 
                    is a <i>spoken</i> language, but not an official language itself. All written things in Switzerland are done so in standard German, so the words below would be 
                    different to write than they are to say! There is no spelling for Swiss-German because it isn't a written language, so what you see below is the closest 
                    written interpretation of the words spoken. If in doubt and if you know how to speak normal German, you can also use that - virtually all Swiss-German 
                    speakers also speak normal German.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Learning a few could also help you make a good impression on the locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses ().
