                    Switzerland has one of the best developed and safest public transport systems in Europe, boasting rail, tram, ferry and 
                    bus. There are trains for rapid city travel and regional travel, as well as mountain lines, so it may come as no surprise 
                    to hear that the country has one of the densest rail networks on the planet. So dense, in fact, that all the rail lines 
                    combined total over 5,200km (3,200 miles)! Not bad for a nation only 41,285 sq km (15,940 sq mi) in area.

                    While the public transport is reasonably priced in Switzerland, taxis most certainly are not. Typically, the fare will start 
                    at around CHF 6.50, with additional increments of CHF 3.50 for every kilometre. This makes taxis a service best avoided 
                    unless you're in an emergency. Also, as with most other things in Switzerland, a service charge is automatically included 
                    in the bill. So, if you do find yourself taking a taxi, you certainly don't have to worry about leaving a tip.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Like the rest of the country, people are typically well behaved on public transport in Switzerland. Taking phone
                    calls is permitted on transport, but it is best to keep your voice down as much as you can; this goes for normal
                    conversations, too. If you find people glaring at you, you have probably been too loud. For as well mannered as the 
                    Swiss typically are, you may be surprised to hear that when it comes to waiting for public transport and the subsequent 
                    boarding of the vehicle, all manners go out the window; be prepared for people to barge in front of you and fail to wait 
                    in any orderly manner whatsoever. We mean this seriously when we say, don't be afraid to use your elbows!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled. Trains and buses can get busy during peak
                    hours, so seating will be at a premium. Do the right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. Unfortunately, it isn't
                    something that happens enough in Switzerland (the Swiss are happy to help others, but tend to need to be asked first), but there 
                    is no need to add to that problem. You are representing your country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously 
                    will leave a positive impression on the locals.

                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! - Switzerland has a <i>lot</i> of travel pass options. Note, too, that fares are set by the government, 
                    meaning that the price will be the same whether you buy your ticket two days or two minutes in advance. Having this central 
                    authoritive connection also means that, even if your journey spans multiple carriers, the one ticket will suffice for the entire 
                    journey. Public transport really is incredibly flexible in Switzerland, so be sure to check out the different travel passes available. 
                    Most tend to give you free access to over 500 museums, too!
