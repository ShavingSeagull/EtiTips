                    Two things tend to come to mind when people think of cuisine in Germany - sausages and beer. That may sound like a 
                    stereotype, but it's not entirely wrong. Beer is a huge part of German culinary culture, with the world famous
                    Oktoberfest originating in Munich and continuing to be observed to this day. Naturally, nothing accompanies a crisp
                    German beer better than a spicy bratwurst.

                    The signature dishes are Spätzle (egg-based pasta) and Bratwurst (long sausage).

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: 5-10% of bill</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping is an acceptable practice in Germany, but, perhaps unsurprisingly owing to Germans' meticulous nature, there is a 'correct'
                    and 'incorrect' way to tip. When you signal the waiter for the bill, you should tell him/her out loud how much you are going to pay.
                    For example: if your bill is €18.50, you should say "I wish to pay €20", thereby signalling that you are leaving a €1.50 tip.
                    <strong>Never</strong> leave your tip on the table, as this is seen as impolite.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Service charges are often included, but it is still customary to leave something for the staff. As a general rule of thumb, 5-10% of
                    the bill will suffice, but often times, especially for smaller bills, simply rounding up to the next Euro will do - a bill of €9.20
                    would result in you paying €10, for example. Naturally, if the service was poor, you are not expected to leave anything and this will
                    likely be noticed by the staff, which can help you convey your disappointment without using words.

					<strong>- No tipping expected, unless running a tab.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in Germany isn't really expected. You can always round up the bill if you wish, but it 
                    isn't an expected custom. That being said, running a tab is quite common here and in the event that you do start a tab, a
                    small consideration is customary when you pay the bill at the end - somewhere in the region of €2 will suffice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with restaurants, if you are receiving table service, tipping will be expected. In the event you are drinking in an
                    establishment with table service, following the guide for restaurants above will serve you well. In general, adding a couple of
                    Euros to the bill will be enough, unless you are living it up with bottle after bottle of Dom Perignon!

                <p>
                    Tipping in cafés in Germany isn't expected at all, so don't feel the need to leave something. Naturally, if you were lucky
                    enough to have the world's best service, then feel free to leave a little something if you wish, but that is entirely
                    up to you. If you feel the need to give something, simply rounding up the bill to the next Euro will definitely suffice.

                <p>
                    When toasting in Germany, the word to use is "Prost!" (the 'O' is pronounced as the 'O' in 'top'. Also, put a slight roll on the 'R'). 
                    If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass. Toasting is a popular past-time, so it
                    would be a good idea to learn the local word!

                <p>
                    Today, it is very common to see groups of friends split the bill in a restaurant, with each person paying for what they ordered. 
                    Older people will usually pay for the table, but amongst the younger generations this is unlikely. Wait staff are more than happy 
                    to accomodate splitting the bill, partly due to the fact that a group of people leaving individual tips amounts to more than a group 
                    tip! Bear in mind that a lot of establishments (unless they are large chains) don't take card payments, so always make sure you bring cash with you.

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Germany, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>After you take your seat, wait for the host or someone to say "Guten Appetit!" (enjoy your meal). It is rude to begin eating beforehand.</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands above the table, but your elbows off while seated, not just while eating</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Bring your food to your mouth, not your mouth to your food</li>
                    <li>Use your cutlery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Try not to leave food on your plate, it is considered impolite</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to bring a gift. Either wine or flowers (not red roses) work well.
                    </li>
