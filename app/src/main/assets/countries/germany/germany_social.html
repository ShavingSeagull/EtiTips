                    With a history spanning over a thousand years, Germany is one of Europe's major nations and a huge global
                    economy. Known for their industrious attitude and strong work ethic, the Germans have remained a wealthy
                    nation inspite of recent global financial troubles over the last 10 years. Known during the Middle Ages 
                    as the Holy Roman Empire (despite not being holy, Roman or a true empire), the modern day Germany is no less
                    powerful on the world stage.

                    Germans are famous for their stoic nature. They are often the butt of a joke about being humourless, despite having 
                    a healthy comic scene. It is true that most Germans tend to appear extremely methodical and level-headed, so don't
                    mistake this for aloofness of rudeness if you speak to them. Germans have received a bad reputation for being arrogant
                    when they go on holiday abroad and, while this is a matter for the individual to decide, their hospitality toward
                    foreign visitors in Germany is without question.

                    To conduct oneself well in Germany, it is important to keep a level head as they do. You will get nowhere if you act
                    boistrously or rudely. Shouting in the street should absolutely be avoided and keeping a good degree of social grace
                    would be a wise idea. Be sure to speak politely, but directly - Germans aren't known for beating around the bush. Also,
                    don't be put-off if someone you are speaking to doesn't smile much - it is just the German way and it certainly doesn't
                    mean they don't like you! If you are greeting Germans in at least a partially formal setting, be sure to shake hands with 
                    everyone there. The nature of greetings and farewells also apply a little more in Germany than in other countries in Europe. 
                    It isn't uncommon to be greeted by shop staff, so check out the common words section below for some handy things to make you 
                    stand out in the right way!

                <p>
                    Small talk isn't popular in Germany. If you find yourself talking to a stranger, the chances are you will be talking about
                    religion, politics or philosophy - it isn't called the Land of Poets and Thinkers for nothing! This may actually come as
                    a relief because many people struggle with small talk or find it superficial and pointless. You may have a more in-depth
                    conversation with the average Joe here, but it's certain to be an eye-opening chat and could be a great way to start a
                    a cultural exchange!

                    It is a long-running joke, especially in the UK, but you really shouldn't mention the war (World War II). Germans are not
                    proud of their past in this respect and take every opportunity to move past it. Dragging up old issues, especially ones you
                    likely weren't alive to experience, is a sure-fire way to make yourself deeply unpopular here. Best to leave the past to the
                    past.

                    You may think the stalwart nature of the Germans would make a romantic life difficult in Germany....and you'd be right, at 
                    least to a certain degree. Germans are notoriously anti-touchy-feely, so keep your hands to yourself! If you are travelling to
                    Germany with your sweetheart, a similar behviour should be followed. Germans aren't fond of public displays of affection, so 
                    it's best to keep that stuff to the privacy of your hotel room.

                    Same sex relationships and marriages are legal in Germany, so please bear this in mind if your personal views differ from the
                    local population's. Berlin was actually the gay capital of the world before Hitler took power (way back in the 1930s!) and the 
                    generally tolerant nature hasn't wavered much. As with the attitude toward public displays of affection, Germans aren't bothered
                    what you do in your private life as long as you keep it to yourself. That being said, people in relationships of any nature should
                    find little resistance from the native people.
