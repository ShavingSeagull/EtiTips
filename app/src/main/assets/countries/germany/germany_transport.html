                    Germany has one of the best developed (and cheapest) public transport systems in Europe, boasting rail, tram, metro and 
                    bus. There are trains for rapid city travel and regional travel and trams which often avoid roads and even go 
                    underground. While not every city has the same setup, even the small towns have a bus system at the least.

					<strong>- Round up to the nearest Euro.</strong>

                <p>
                    Taxis are in abundance in Germany, but can prove to be quite an expensive way to travel. It is customary, though not
                    set in stone, to round up to the nearest Euro when giving a tip. So, for example, if your fare was €5.40, you would 
                    pay €6, giving 60c tip. The exception to this would be a long trip, such as to the airport, or if the driver has
                    provided exemplary service, such as helping you with luggage. In such a case, giving 10% of the fare is a little more
                    appropriate, though again, entirely up to the individual.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Like the rest of the country, people are generally well behaved on public transport in Germany. Taking phone
                    calls is permitted on transport, but it is best to keep your voice down as much as you can; this goes for normal
                    conversations, too. If you find people glaring at you, you have probably been too loud. This may seem obvious, but
                    don't put your feet on the seat opposite. It is a particular bugbear of German transport users and won't stand you 
                    in good stead, especially as a tourist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled. Trains and the metro can get crowded during peak
                    hours, so seating will be at a premium. Do the right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. Unfortunately, it isn't
                    something that happens enough in Germany (without asking directly), but there is no need to add to that problem. You are
                    representing your country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will leave a positive impression
                    on the locals.

                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! - Unlike a lot of other Western European countries, Germany doesn't use a smart card system for
                    public transport travel. Expect to buy a ticket for your journey, but make sure to have the correct change. Tickets for buses
                    can still be bought from the driver, too. German stations typically don't have a turnstile or gate system, either. You are trusted, 
                    like good boys and girls, to buy a ticket for your journey. Failure to do so could result in a €60 fine, however, and seeing as the
                    fares in Germany are some of the cheapest in Western Europe, it seems a bit redundant to have to pay €60 for a €2.60 journey...
