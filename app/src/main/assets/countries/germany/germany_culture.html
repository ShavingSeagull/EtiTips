                    Germany is known as 'The Land of Poets and Thinkers'. Many great philosophical minds have originated from Germany, 
                    such as Friedrich Nietzsche, Immanuel Kant and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. Although, perhaps most famously, was
                    Albert Einstein, one of the world's greatest minds and physicists. German culture is centered around stoicism
                    and an industrialised attitude, which produces tremendous work ethic and competent competitors in industry and sport.

                    The official language is German and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Although the number of people no longer following a religion is high at 38%, unlike its neighbour, the Netherlands, 
                    Germany is still majority religious, with 56% of the population following Christianity. Owing to their nature as great 
                    thinkers, it is perhaps unsurprising that most German people ponder and contemplate in something outside of what they see.

                    The Germans will cherish a good debate about religion and, as stated on the Social tab, this will often replace the day-to-day
                    small-talk you usually find in other countries and societies. It can often be said that you should generally avoid talking
                    about religion if it can be helped, but in Germany the opposite tends to be true. Not ones to dictate doctrine, any discussion
                    about religion will likely centre around learning and understanding rather than argument and criticism.

                    The general dress sense is a little more reserved than elsewhere in the Western world. While dress sense will be fairly 
                    similar here, it is wise to err on the side of caution rather than making a spectacle of yourself. There is room for 
                    individual style, of course, but it's best to be sensible about what you wear.

                    Dress in the workplace is important in Germany. As with most places, corporate life is dominated by smart dress, but, unlike
                    other places, shined shoes will make you stand out for all the right reasons here. So, be sure to break out the polish and brush
                    if you find yourself in a work setting while in Germany!

                <p>
                    The Germans are known for their direct, no-nonsense approach. There are few grey areas in German life, with most things
                    neatly compartmentalised and organised efficiently. You may find Germans difficult to get to know initially, as they
                    prefer to spend their time being productive rather than making conversation with those they don't know. That being said, 
                    while it may take a little extra time to earn a German's friendship, if you do so, you will likely have a friend for life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time keeping, time keeping, time keeping. It is absolutely imperitive that you be on time for everything in Germany. To be
                    early is rude because you have put your host at a disadvantage, while to be late is rude because you have kept them waiting. 
                    If you arrive early, have a coffee or take a walk around the area until no more than five minutes before your scheduled time. If you
                    are going to be late because of something out of your control, contact the person you are meeting immediately and apologise
                    profusely. This may sound like it belongs in the Work Life section below, but honestly, time keeping is important to all
                    Germans in all walks of life.
                </p>

                    For all its rules, regulations and efficiencies, Germany is actually rather liberal. Providing you act respectfully toward
                    others, most Germans won't mind what you are or what you do. This segues well into our next topic, which is prostitution.
                    The 'World's oldest profession' is legal and taxed in Germany, contributing a huge amount to the national economy. The German
                    attitude to prostitution has always been rather accepting, making it unsurprising that is remains legal today. Whether Germans 
                    allow it due to liberalism or the fact that it makes more sense to legalise and tax an indsutry that will exist whether it's legal or not, 
                    is another question entirely. That being said, if you are so inclined as to partake in the local delights, please keep the
                    fact that the workers are protected and part of a legal industry in mind - treat them with the respect you'd treat anybody else. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Working life is perhaps where Germans shine the most. Here is where the rules, regulations and industrious attitude come together to
                    form a very well-oiled machine. Work life in Germany is similar to everyday life in the sense that things are compartmentalised and
                    organised - work relationships and social relationships are kept separate, for example. There is time for work and there is time outside
                    of work and rarely will the two intertwine. If you need to deal with Germans in business, do so during work hours only - they will find
                    it deeply unpleasurable to have to mix work into their freetime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though times are slowly changing, formality is still king in Germany. It is not uncommon for colleagues who have sat across from each other
                    for years, still refer to each other as Mr X and Ms Y. This can be common tripping ground for foreigners working in Germany, especially when
                    they begin learning German and encounter the Sie vs Du conundrum (both meaning 'you' - Sie is formal, Du is informal). This, along with the
                    separation of work and pleasure mentioned above, leads to much less socialising at work and, most notably, after work. Don't expect to be
                    invited for a beer after hours on a Friday unless it is a special occasion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know we mentioned it in the last section, but it is worth mentioning again. Be on time! If you thought it was important in everyday life, 
                    it is doubly important at work. If you are used to turning up to meetings five or ten minutes late, or talking about the result from the big
                    game last night before the meeting starts, you will have a very rude awakening in Germany. Work is for work, play is for play. It may seem
                    colder and more anti-social this way, but it's just the way things are.
