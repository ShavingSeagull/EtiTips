                    Portuguese culture is dominated by food, drink, tradition, love and family. People can often naively mix the Spanish and Portuguese 
                    together, but this is definitely misguided. The Portuguese pride themselves on their individuality and their beliefs, both as a people 
                    and a society. They have also had a huge influence on the world throughout time, with the large nation of Brazil speaking Portuguese as a 
                    direct result of their colonial relationship with Portugal some years ago.

                    The official language is Portuguese and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Portugal is hugely majority Christian, with a massive 81% of the population identifying with the Roman Catholic branch of the faith and a further 
                    3% identifying with other branches (as of the 2011 census). The second highest affiliation is non-religious and undeclared, coming in at only 7% and 
                    8% respectively, showing that, unlike much of the rest of western Europe, the younger generations are certainly not moving away from religious affiliations, 
                    though many hold an identity without actively practicing. Though typically seen as a religious people, the Portuguese state is secular, with a clear 
                    line between the government and the church.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many Portuguese, as with quite a few other things, can prove to be very passionate about their religion, so it would be wise to keep an err 
                    of decorum should you find yourself discussing the subject. It would be incredibly ill advised to chastise Christianity in front of the locals, as doing 
                    so will likely make you appear a 'pig-headed foreigner', so to speak. Discussing religion is a sensitive area in most places, but in countries 
                    like Portugal, it's probably best just avoided altogether.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    Dress sense in Portugal is interesting in that it can sometimes be seen as a bit old fashioned, yet stylish at the same time. Typically, what this equates to 
                    is men wearing sensible, smart-casual attire most of the time and women wearing dresses, which can be a benefit in the hot local climate. Big flashy displays 
                    of colour or 'peacocking' as it can be known, isn't a favoured practice in Portugal. If you want to avoid drawing stares here, it would definitely be wise to 
                    err on the side of the restrained rather than breaking out the cheesy Hawaiian shirts!

                    A warning about dressing in churches: Portugal has a beautiful variety of cathedrals and churches that are popular with tourists, but they are still 
                    places of worship and therefore a certain standard of dress is expected if you want to be let through the door. For the ladies, the shoulders (and cleavage, if any) 
                    should be covered (a light scarf will do) and for the gents, no bare chests and switch from shorts to any form of trouser if you can. Jeans, linen trousers 
                    and slacks are all fine. Sandals are acceptable for men and women, too. Also, avoid visiting during mass and for the love of God (see what we did there?), don't 
                    think about taking pictures while a service is ongoing.

                    As with neighbouring Spain, time keeping isn't as stringent as it is elsewhere. Indeed, the pace of life is definitely a lot slower here, so it's best 
                    to put the idea of sticking to sharp schedules aside, whether you are moving to Portugal or just here on holiday. The locals prefer to take the approach of 
                    stepping down a gear to enjoy life and the fruits of their beautiful country and you should definitely follow suit. It's easy to feel as though there isn't a 
                    care in the world here - how many places can we say that in these days?

                    Family is a hugely important concept in Portuguese culture. Families here tend to be large and they tend to be close, so this is certainly something to 
                    bear in mind if you are dating/marrying a local, for example. The saying of 'marrying into the family' exists everywhere, but nowhere is it more 
                    applicable than in Portugal. Boys will be close to their mothers and elders will be held in high esteem. If you have Portuguese friends and find yourself invited 
                    to a family gathering, you should definitely accept. The food alone will likely blow you away, but the atmosphere of a warm, loving family will definitely make it 
                    worthwhile.

                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Portuguese businesses operate according to a traditional hierarchical structure, with age and seniority taking precedence. Decisions always come from the top and they rarely 
                    come in the form of individual thought; rather, a managerial consensus will tend to be the way decisions are reached. It may sound counterintuitive depending on where you're 
                    from, but knowing one's place in a Portuguese office will serve you well. If you're trying to set up a meeting or appointment with a Portuguese cohort, avoid the month of 
                    August if you can, as this is generally when businesses will take their vacations.

                    A foreigner in Portugal for business? Then pay attention to the following tip as it may just save your deal: don't talk turkey at a lunch or dinner meeting! The Portuguese 
                    like to conduct business with people they trust and meal times are for eating and socialising, not working. If you're invited to a meal-based meeting, spend the time 
                    getting to know your cohort personally rather than attempting to negotiate any business. If and when your associate wishes to talk business, they will likely do so 
                    at the office. Talking about sport (football/soccer in particular) or family life are two popular subjects here. There is a chance your host may bring work up over a 
                    meal and if this occurs then, obviously, you should oblige. It's best, however, not to bring it up unless they do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A quick note about time keeping: while the Portuguese typically take a slower approach to life, this most certainly does not apply to you. If you have a meeting scheduled 
                    at 9am, you better make sure you turn up on time! In Portugal, the Portuguese can turn up for a meeting ten minutes late, but you can't!
