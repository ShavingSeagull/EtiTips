                    While many may not realise, Portugal is actually one of the oldest nation states in the world, with its status as an independent country being 
                    recognised for 900 years, but with a history dating well over 1000. Once a profound global power with an empire to match, Portugal is now a nation 
                    steeped in rich history, great food, traditional values and, of course, the home of one of the most famous football players of all-time: Cristiano Ronaldo.

                    The capital city is Lisbon and the currency is the Euro (€).

                    Greetings are an important social custom in Portugal. Whether meeting someone for the first time or the hundreth, you are expected to greet them 
                    when you meet and give a farewell when you part ways. Typically, this will be by using <i>Bom dia/Boa tarde/Boa noite</i> (good morning/
                    good afternoon/good evening), with a simple <i>Adeus</i> (goodbye) as a farewell. Note, too, that when greeting someone, a handshake or an air kiss 
                    is expected - a handshake for men (or a hug for friends) and an air kiss on both cheeks (starting with the right) for a man and a woman or two women. 
                    Yes, gents, even if you don't know the woman well, you are expected to greet with a kiss.

                    The Portuguese are a traditional, conservative bunch. To do well here, it is important to hold oneself well and act like people are watching. While the 
                    Portuguese can seem a little on the loud side when they speak, this is rarely a display of annoyance or anger and more just a part of the typical Latin 
                    passion that is common for the region. What does differ from their other Latin cousins, however, is the lack of gesticulation. Speaking with the hands is seen 
                    as boistrous and rude, so it is best to keep your wild limbs under control if you are one of those who lets their hands do the talking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike neighbouring Spain, the concept of personal space does exist in Portugal and about an arm's length is fine. It is, however, commonplace and an accepted 
                    practice to include physicality during conversation - think pats on the shoulder or touches of the arm etc. For some, this is as natural as breathing, but for 
                    others it can cause a simulation of a cat jumping out of its skin. Cultures tend to vary heavily in their social practices, but at least you can consider yourself 
                    warned if you are from a culture that doesn't practice much physicality in their social engagements. Don't be put-off, though - you're not likely to find the locals 
                    touching you up if they don't know you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, a word on English speaking: in cities, you should fare rather well, as is the case with most places in Europe. As is also usually the case, the level 
                    of English speakers drops the more into the countryside you travel. Even in cities, don't be alarmed if the passerby you stopped for directions doesn't 
                    understand you. In such cases, it would be best to ask at a hotel or restaurant, or approach someone under the age of 30 - the youth are embracing speaking 
                    English as a second language much more than the generations before them.

                    The Portuguese are as passionate in love as they are in life. A relationship with a local will likely consist of many messages every day, lots of sweet nothings and 
                    and attitude that the world would end without you. It is all rather genuine, too, as most Portuguese folks, both men and women, are family oriented and traditionally 
                    minded. The local romance culture is centered around expression, openness and devotion. Perfect if you're into that sort of thing!

                <p>
                    Despite being one of the more traditional and conservative places in Europe, Portugal legalised same-sex marriage in 2010. This may come as a relief to any readers 
                    who are of the related persuasion. The general attitude toward same-sex relationships has also softened with each passing generation, so whether you're a man or a 
                    woman dating a man or a woman, you have no need to fear missing out on Portugal's wonderful culture and its warm, vibrant people.
