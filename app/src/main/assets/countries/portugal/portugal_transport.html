                    Portugal boasts an impressive public transport network, with trains, a variety of bus systems (both short and long distance 
                    available) and trams. Lisbon and Porto also have an extensive metro system, which can be a great way to avoid the traffic of 
                    a typical metropolitan area, as well as providing an ideal way to travel to and from the airport if you don't have much luggage 
                    and are travelling light.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with much of the rest of Portugal, tipping taxi drivers is by no means an expected custom. You would be hard-pressed to find a local 
                    tipping a driver, so it's safe to follow suit. Of course, if the driver has helped you with mountains of luggage or rushed frantically 
                    so you wouldn't miss your flight home, leaving a little something certainly wouldn't be turned down! A Euro per pag or just a Euro or two in 
                    general if you're feeling generous, will definitely suffice.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Like the rest of the country, people are generally well behaved on public transport in Portugal. Taking phone
                    calls is permitted on transport, but it is best to keep your voice down as much as you can; if you find people glaring at you, you have 
                    probably been too loud. Bear in mind that the weather in Portugal is very humid and at rush hour, the public transport networks could 
                    become a bit uncomfortable. Think of others and make sure you're wearing deodorant...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled. Seating can be at a premium on public transport, especially 
                    during busy periods, so be sure to do the right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. You are representing your country when you go abroad, 
                    so making the effort to act courteously will leave a positive impression on the locals.

                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! Lisbon has the Lisboa Card - a travel card that gives free travel and acts as a free pass for 26 museums, monuments and 
                    heritage sites, as well as giving discounts on lots of other things. Definitely something to indulge in if you plan on seeing as much as you can! 
                    Similarly, Porto offers the Andante Card, which acts as a reloadable travel card for unlimited use across all of the public transport networks in the city. 
                    Very handy indeed.

                        Forget to pick up a Lisboa Card or an Andante Card if you're in Lisbon or Porto respectively. 
                        They can make your stay much easier and cheaper!
