                    Portugal, like its neighbour, Spain, is famous for its cuisine, with seafood being the number one choice. A nation in love with the sea, 
                    it is perhaps unsurprising that the national dish is centered around fish, too. Aside from the vast variety of delicious treats, Portuguese 
                    wine is also famed for its rich taste and high quality. The great food also comes at a great price, with Portugal enjoying some of the best 
                    costs for food and drink in Europe.

                    The signature dishes are Bacalhau (salted cod) and Caldo Verde (vegetable &amp; sausage soup).

                    Portugal has a confusing tipping culture in that it both exists and doesn't at the same time. Schrödinger's tipping, if you will. 
                    While a tip will never be refused, nor is it rude in any way, a lot of people don't tip at all here. That being said, the general 
                    rule of thumb will be that if you received great service, it certainly wouldn't hurt to leave something. For cheaper restaurants, however, 
                    it is rather typical not to tip at all. For anything a bit higher quality, 5-10% of the bill will definitely suffice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure to check your receipt before leaving a tip! Though it isn't common practice, some establishments - especially in tourist areas - 
                    may include a 10% service charge on your bill automatically. Check your receipt first and if the charge is present, you don't have to leave 
                    anything extra.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to leave the tip in cash if you can! While a lot of card machines will allow you to enter a gratuity, this doesn't always go to the 
                    waiter. So, if you want to reward your waiter for excellent service, leave the tip in cash.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in Portugal isn't expected at all. You can always throw your change in the tip jar if you wish, 
                    but it isn't an expected custom whatsoever. If you are receiving table service, however, giving a little something would be a good idea - a Euro or two 
                    will cover it.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in cafés here is highly unusual, though again, won't be turned down. If you have received stellar service and feel the need to leave 
                    something, rounding up the bill to the next Euro is common practice for tipping in Portugal. So, for a bill of €2.70, you would pay €3, leaving 
                    30c as the tip.

                    When toasting in Portugal, the word to use is "Saúde!" (pronounced sul-duh). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                    It is fairly typical in Portugal that the person who invited the other will pay the entire bill; however, it is polite to offer to pay, even if you are the guest. 
                    Note, however, that it is typical on dates for a man to pay for the woman, with protests falling on deaf ears. Chivalry is not dead in Portugal. Usually, when dining with 
                    relatives, the eldest person will foot the bill and it is polite to let them do so.

                    Perhaps unsurprisingly for a nation famed for its cuisine, there is a general standard expected at the dinner table. General household standards may have eased 
                    a bit over time, though the following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Portugal, either in their homes or in public 
                    establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Always leave a little food on your plate at the end. Unlike most other cultures, in Portugal this is seen as polite</li>
                    <li>
                        When eating at a restaurant, appetisers will be brought to your table as soon as you sit down. In most places, you would be excused for assuming these were 
                        free; however, in Portugal everything on the table is paid for. If you don't want to indulge in the appetisers, you can politely decline them when the waiter 
                        brings them over
                    </li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, wait for the most important person to start eating before you do. This will either be the host or the oldest person at the table</li>
                    <li>The host will sit at the head of the table, with their spouse on the opposite end. The most honoured guest will sit to the right of the host</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands on/above the table at all times, not just when eating. No elbows, though!</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Use your cutlery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>Be prepared to take your time! Eating in Portugal is almost ceremonial and nobody likes to rush the experience</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is very good practice to bring a small gift. Either expensive chocolates, wine or flowers (not red roses) 
                        work well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unlike many other western European countries, you won't receive your bread on a separate plate. Place your bread on the rim of your dinner plate or 
                        on the table next to it. You also won't receive any butter with it, as the bread is supposed to be used to mop up excess sauce
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
