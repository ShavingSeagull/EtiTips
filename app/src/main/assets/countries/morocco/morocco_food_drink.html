                    Morocco is a king of cuisine among its north African neighbours and their specialites are beef and poultry dishes. The food can be as 
                    varied as the culture, with influences present from the country's very mixed history. One of the greatest culinary accomplishments is undoubtedly 
                    couscous, which is a common food in the West now, too.

                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Couscous (wheat pasta) and Tagine (slow cooked meat - tagine is actually the name of the pot).

                    Tipping is an everyday part of Moroccan culture, with most services engaging in the practice. Luckily for travellers, the Moroccan Dirham is very 
                    cheap compared to currencies of larger countries, so adding a tip will hardly set you back much. Naturally, if the service was poor, you can forego 
                    the tip. For restaurants, 10-15% of the bill is the average amount to leave. Of course, if you wish to leave more then you can and you'll likely make 
                    the waiter's day at the same time!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note, that some restaurants will include a service charge on the bill. Be sure to check for this before leaving a tip, as the presence of a charge will 
                    nullify the need to leave any extra.

                    Though Morocco is a Muslim country, bars do actually exist, though they are required to be indoors with their windows blocked from the public being 
                    able to see in from the outside. Tipping in bars is similar to restaurants, with 10% of the bill being appropriate.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As with all other services in Morocco, the generally acceptable tipping rate is 10% for cafés, too. As should be obvious, if the service was non-existent or 
                    poor, not leaving a tip is acceptable.

                    When toasting in Egypt, the word to use is "بالصحة" (pronounced 'b-ssah'). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                    Splitting the bill doesn't follow set rules in Morocco. It is common to see people paying for what they ordered, though it really depends on the group who are eating. 
                    It is fairly common, too, to pay for the entire meal if you invite somebody to dinner who you don't see often or haven't seen for a while. Likewise, they will 
                    probably do the same for you, so don't be surprised to find yourself in a fight to pay the bill. It is better to relent and treat them next time.

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table. The following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Morocco, either in 
                    their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to take your shoes off before entering</li>
                    <li>
                        Moroccans commonly share some of the food on their plate. There is a ceremony to this, however. They (or you) will offer, it will be refused and if offered again, it should be 
                        accepted. Don't make the mistake of failing to offer or accepting some food the second time it is insisted upon!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dishes are typically shared communal sizes and your host will keep feeding you. Keep your portions smaller and when you're full and offered more food, simply smile, pat your stomach and 
                        say "La, shu-kran" (no, thank you). Your host will be pleased that you are full. Don't forget to pat your stomach, though - that's the key to notifying how full you are!
                    </li>
                    <li>The right hand is king in Morocco. You must eat your food with the right hand only. The left may be used for cutting something, for example, but use it sparingly</li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure to leave a little bit of food on your plate when you are finished, even if you're hungry! To clear your plate denotes that the host didn't feed you enough and 
                        will be taken very personally. Naturally, this doesn't apply in restaurants
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Following on from the point above, if second helpings are available, taking some would be a huge compliment to the host, as it shows their cooking is enjoyable. Just be sure 
                        to leave a little bit on the plate when you're done
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is very good practice to bring a gift. Either figs, sweets or pastries work well. Make sure you give the gift with the 
                        right hand, or both if it's heavy
                    </li>
                    <li>Be sure to compliment your host on their home, as this will be a great source of pride for the lady of the house</li>
                    <li>Don't expect easy access to alcohol as Morocco is a Muslim country. If you are offered alcohol, be sure not to drink to excess!</li>
                    <li>Moroccans will generally forgive etiquette mistakes by foreigners, so don't panic about any dinner dates you may have!</li>
