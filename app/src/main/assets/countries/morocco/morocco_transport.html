                    Morocco has a decent public transport system, focused largely on buses and trains. The rail system proves fairly reliable, though the service is prone to delays. 
                    Trains have first and second class carriages and if you're planning to travel overnight, we definitely recommend spending the extra for a <i>couchette</i>, which 
                    is safer due to couchette passengers being locked in their own carriage with a guard.

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: Round up the bill</strong>

                    Tipping taxi drivers doesn't need to be hard work. Generally, it is safe to just round up the bill, though often there will be a fixed price agreed for the journey, 
                    which is a whole number. Whether you choose to leave something on top of this amount is up to you, just know that the agreed price is likely a little higher than the 
                    journey is worth in the first place...

                    Morocco has a few differing taxi services. One of those, which is unlike any other service, is the Grand Taxi. This is a people carrier that holds six people and operates 
                    along the most popular routes. What makes them unique is that they take a mix of passengers, but won't leave until all six seats are full. If you are in a hurry - or just 
                    desire more space around you - you can pay for multiple seats. Sometimes, if there are five passengers waiting for a sixth, they will agree to split the cost of the sixth 
                    seat among them. Note, however, that Grand Taxis are involved in a few road accidents every year, so it is advised not to travel at night, when the drivers have often been 
                    driving all day and sometimes fall asleep at the wheel!

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    There is an odd etiquette practice on Moroccan public transport, which indicates that you shouldn't eat without offering your neighbouring passengers 
                    some of your food, too. In fact, it is extremely rude not to, as it is seen that you have food while they are going without. Either refrain from eating 
                    on transport (the easiest method) or bring a little extra to share with other passengers. The ritual of refusing the food will then take place, but after 
                    insisting a couple of times, they will take the food with appreciation. Likewise, if offered food, even if you're full, it is polite to accept some. Doing 
                    so will make you very popular indeed, as foreigners who engage with local customs are held in high regard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, as seating will be at a premium, especially during busy hours. Do the 
                    right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. You are representing your country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will 
                    leave a positive impression on the locals, especially in a society that reveres its elders so much.

                        Rent a car while in Morocco. The roads aren't particularly safe to drive on, owing to the high number 
                        of accidents every year. A fair few drivers gain their licence through bribery, so...
