                    Morocco has had a long varied history with many different cultures and people calling the nation home. Hundreds of years ago, the 
                    Almohads actually controlled a large portion of nearby Spain, too, which can be seen reflected in some architecture in the south of the 
                    country. Modern day Morocco is a tourist hotspot and has remained a very popular destination for many years.

                <p>
                    Greetings are an important social custom in Morocco. Whether meeting someone for the first time or the hundreth, you are expected to greet them 
                    when you meet and give a farewell when you part ways. When greeting someone, a handshake or a kiss on the cheek is expected - a handshake for men, 
                    kisses on the cheek for women and a handshake for men and women. Note, there are caveats to this that you must be aware of! It is common to see two 
                    men holding hands or kissing on the cheeks when they meet here. Though homosexuality is strictly outlawed in Islam, Muslims also don't believe it really 
                    exists, thus physical affection between men is not out of the ordinary at all. When two men become friends, the handshake will likely evolve to cheek kisses. 
                    The greeting between men and women can also be murky waters. If the woman extends her hand, the man should shake it. However, if she does not, the man should 
                    give a polite bow instead. The woman must extend the hand for a handshake first!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moroccans are a notably tolerant, friendly people. Always pay attention to conduct yourself politely and with good manners here, as making the wrong move, 
                    even doing something that would be acceptable in your home country, could unwittingly offend the locals, making life harder for you while you're in Morocco and 
                    travellers who will follow you in the future. Certainly, if you behave with respect, the locals will be more than happy to open theirselves and their homes to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Morocco is a Muslim country and so it is important to remember that a clear, strong distinction exists between men and women. Please don't be surprised if, as a woman 
                    with your husband, you ask a Moroccan man a question only to find he answers your husband and not you. This isn't as it may appear on the surface and is done to show 
                    respect to the husband rather than ignorance toward the wife. Likewise, a husband with a wife asking a Moroccan woman a question shouldn't be surprised to find she 
                    answers his wife and not him. It works both ways!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, a word on body language: The rules aren't too alien compared to the rest of the world, though there are a couple of things to bear in mind. It is rude to point 
                    at someone using your index finger or to use your finger to beckon somebody to you. If you wish to call someone over, place your hand with your palm facing down and conduct 
                    a sweeping motion toward your body. Touching, while very common between members of the same sex, is absolutely out of the question between members of the opposite sex. Even a 
                    pat on the arm could easily be misconstrued here. Men will touch men, women will touch women, but men and women (who aren't related or married) should absolutely refrain from 
                    physical contact. Keep body language very respectful when dealing with the opposite sex, both for men and for women.
                </p>

                    Romancing in Morroco has strict rules. If you're here with your partner, you should absolutely refrain from public displays of affection. Morocco is a conservative country 
                    due to its dominant religion and this must be respected when travelling here, as its rules are upheld with little leniency. Women in particular must be extra vigilant to 
                    behave with respect. Any form of public affection toward a man, even her own husband, will give the locals the impression that she is 'easy'. This is not a look you want to 
                    wear here. Ironically, even if the husband is the one to show affection to the woman, it will be her who is tarred with the 'easy' brush, not him. Not entirely fair, perhaps, 
                    but that's the way it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Morocco is a male-oriented society, so ladies must be prepared for some good old fashioned cat-calling and attention on the street; it is extremely likely that you'll experience 
                    it here at least once if you aren't with a man. Playing up to it would be a bad idea unless you're in Morocco for...certain things. If you wish to avoid the attention, ignoring it 
                    is actually the most effective approach and dressing conservatively will help prevent too much attention in the first place. While attention is commonplace, a Moroccan man touching you 
                    absolutely is not and is deemed unacceptable. If such a situation arises, you should make a scene by shouting "Shooma!" (shame on you!) and passersby will likely step in to help you.
                </p>

                    An important note for same-sex couples: Morocco is a Muslim country and Islam is most certainly <b>not</b> gay-friendly. When we say you should keep any and all forms of affection 
                    to the privacy of your hotel room, we don't mean you may get a few harsh words thrown at you as you may in your home country. To openly display homosexuality in any Muslim country, 
                    Morocco included, is to risk your safety or, in some places, your life. This doesn't mean Morocco should be avoided, but it does mean you will have to behave with the utmost decorum if 
                    you come here. Naturally, don't broach the subject with any locals, either.

                <h3 class="section-header">Useful Words</h3>
                <p>
                        Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting Morocco. 
                        Learning a few could also help you make a good impression on the locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses (). 
                        Morocco, like most other Arab countries, lists Arabic as its official language, but largely uses its own Arabic dialect in practice. We will 
                        list the local dialect versions here where possible. Note, all Arabic uses a gutteral sound similar to what you may find in Dutch, Welsh 
                        or Hebrew. When this sound is needed, we will write it as 'kh' - though note there is no hard 'K' sound to it.
