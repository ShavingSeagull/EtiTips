                    Morocco's culture is shaped by its varied history and the differing ethnic groups that have called the country home over the years. A history of 
                    colonisation from the Spanish and French has led to both languages being present in the country in minority capacities, as well as European 
                    cultural influence being present even to this day. An interesting fact: Morocco was the first nation to recognise the United States's independence in 
                    1777 and the treaty they signed in 1786 for safe passage of American ships remains the United States's longest non-broken friendship treaty to this day.

                    The official languages are Arabic (Moroccan dialect) &amp; Berber and the official religion is Islam.

                    Morocco is majority Muslim, with an overwhelming 99% of the population estimated to identify with the faith, the vast majority with the Sunni branch (as of 2010). 
                    The second highest affiliation is Christian, coming in at only 1% of the populace. Islam as a religion is also entwined in state affairs, as is the 
                    case with virtually all Muslim nations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Islam has very strict rules that govern many aspects of daily life. This can range from the place of women in society, to what is acceptable to 
                    speak about when discussing the religion itself. There has been a lot of tension between Muslims and non-Muslims in the last couple of decades, so 
                    it is best, if you are a Western tourist, to be extra vigilant in the way you behave while in Muslim countries. Don't be alarmed, however - Moroccans 
                    are friendly and warm people who will be accommodating regardless of where you're from. That said, it would be extremely wise not to engage in discussion 
                    about religion, especially if you are non-religious. Under no circumstance should you talk about the Muslim prophet, Mohammed; it is just a subject best 
                    avoided altogether. In many countries, speaking ill of him will cost you your life.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    Moroccan dress is conservative, with little-to-no emphasis on bearing flesh. Though times are slowly changing in the big cities, it would still be very wise to follow suit 
                    and dress safely, especially if you are a woman. Bear in mind that Morocco is a country in northern Africa, so the average temperature is rather high. Linen trousers and 
                    stylish shirts/light jackets will be a good choice here. Foreign ladies are not required to wear a headscarf, though do keep in mind that displaying too much flesh will be very frowned upon. 
                    Covering the shoulders, chest and legs is a very good idea. You wouldn't want to give the local men the wrong impression of you!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you intend on visiting religious sites, you will likely find yourself disappointed. The mosques are reserved for Muslims only, with only ruins or disused ones, such as Tin Mal 
                    and Smara, being open for non-Muslim visitors. While you should be able to take a photo of a mosque from the outside (from a decent distance), you definitely shouldn't attempt to 
                    take one of the inside or try and sneak a peak while the door is open - you will be turned away. If you <i>are</i> visiting a working mosque then you'll be Muslim, so we don't have to tell you 
                    what to wear as we're sure you have the idea by now!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are in Morocco on business, be sure to dress conservatively and in dark colours, but smart. The locals place emphasis on snappy dressing as it conveys respect for those you 
                    are dealing with, so be sure to pack your best for a Moroccan meeting.

                    Family is a hugely important concept in Moroccan culture. Families here tend to be large and they tend to be close, so this is certainly something to 
                    bear in mind if you are dating/marrying a local, for example. Children are important, as are elders, who are held in the highest esteem within Moroccan 
                    society and culture. If you spot an older person in need of help, you should definitely lend a hand as you will be setting an incredibly good impression 
                    with the locals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Morocco is famous for its markets, which are like a glimpse into the world of 400 years ago. They are busy, they are loud and they are unforgettable. Also famed is the practice of 
                    haggling, though you can probably forget trying to get a decent price for anything unless you have a local on your side! The market traders are shrewd and very experienced, so a 
                    foreigner will find it very difficult to achieve anything out of the trader that they weren't already prepared to give. Luckily, it is very easy to make friends with the locals, who 
                    are tremendously hospitable, so having cavalry to back you up should certainly be possible!

                <p>
                    A foreigner in Morocco for business? Take note that business will not usually take place until your Moroccan counterpart decides they like you. The personal side of a working 
                    relationship is hugely important, so do take the time to get to know your cohort first. For many Westerners who are used to the opposite, the slower pace of proceedings that typically occurs 
                    may be a little frustrating, but do persevere as trying to conduct business in a Western fashion will prove futile. When it comes to negotiating, it is wise not to take a hard-sell approach, 
                    though do stay firm in your convictions as Moroccans tend to be hard bargainers. Take note that the language of business tends to be French, though some will use English. Be sure to check what 
                    language will be used in the meeting and plan an interpreter if necessary. Avoid scheduling meetings on a Friday, as this is the Muslim holy day. Also, avoid arranging anything during Ramadan, 
                    as businesses will be functioning on a reduced schedule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moroccan time keeping leaves something to be desired, so don't be surprised or angry if your associate arrives late. If a business typically deals with foreign businesses, they do tend to try and 
                    arrive on time, however. Also, Moroccan meetings operate with an open door policy. This means that somebody could not only come into the room during a meeting, but they may even start a discussion 
                    about a totally different subject. You are free to join in with this discussion, but you shouldn't attempt to bring the conversation back to your negotiation - simply allow the new conversation to 
                    finish before getting back to business.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...oh, and remember to use the right hand to shake hands! Right is king, left is unclean. A (sort of) rhyme to help you remember to act like a one-handed pirate while in Morocco.
