                    Greece has a decent public transport network that can provide a great way to get around the country. Buses are by far the 
                    most favoured method of travel, though train is also available (but limited in its coverage) and a metro system exists in Athens. 
                    Ferries also provide a great way to get to the islands off the mainland. Public transport in Greece is reasonably priced, with the 
                    bus fares being set by the government.

                <p>
                    As with much of the rest of Greece, tipping taxi drivers is by no means an expected custom. It is, however, rather common to see people 
                    rounding up the bill to the next Euro, but this is for matters of convenience in avoiding pockets of loose change rather than to 
                    provide a kind gesture to the driver. If you feel the need to give something, rounding up the bill or leaving a Euro or two will definitely 
                    suffice. If you have booked a taxi on a pre-paid schedule (such as for picking you up from the airport and taking you to the hotel), you should give 
                    nothing extra, unless the driver helps you with your luggage.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Like the rest of the country, people are generally well behaved on public transport in Greece. Taking phone calls is permitted on transport, but it 
                    is best to keep your voice down as much as you can; if you find people glaring at you, you have probably been too loud. Note, that on the metro in 
                    Athens, smoking, eating and drinking are not permitted. Lastly, while exuding politeness generally, the Greeks don't really know the concept of lining 
                    up orderly for transport. Expect a free-for-all when the train pulls up (either metro or overland), as the waiting passengers will try to embark before 
                    the people on the train have had a chance to disembark. Elbows to the rescue!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, especially if they are women (and you are a man). 
                    Trains and the metro can get crowded during peak hours, so seating will be at a premium. Do the right thing and give a helping hand 
                    to those in need. You are representing your country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will leave a positive 
                    impression on the locals.

                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! Definitely make use of the metro in Athens. The stations are very clean, the network is very safe and most stations 
                    have ancient artifacts in glass cases. Over 50,000 were discovered when the system was constructed in time for the 2004 Olympic games, so most 
                    stations have become like mini-museums.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another bonus non-etiquette tip! The buses are by far the best way to get around the country. They are run by one company and they're modern, reliable 
                    and very cheap. The major bus network also runs long distance services to all the major cities and towns. Even rural towns will have their own local 
                    bus system, but be aware that the timetables will be in Greek alphabet only. If you pre-book your tickets at the office, however, the Latin alphabet will also 
                    be used.
