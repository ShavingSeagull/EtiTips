                    Greek culture is dominated by food, family, history and a love of life. No matter what culture you're a part of in Europe, you will 
                    unwittingly have been influenced by the Greeks some thousands of years ago. Home to some of the greatest figures humanity has ever known, 
                    such as Aristotle, Plato, Homer and Alexander the Great, Greece has a history that is long, influencial and very proud. If you want to make 
                    friends in Greece quickly, just talk to them about their incredible country.

                    The official language is Greek and the national religion is Christianity.

                <h3 class="section-header">Religion</h3>
                <p>
                    Greece is hugely majority Christian, with 94% of people identifying with the religion and a massive 90% of that belonging to the Orthodox branch of 
                    the faith (as of 2015). The irreligious number just 4%, making Greece the most religious nation in Europe. Greece also has the highest percentage of people 
                    who identify as being 'very religious'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This may be rather obvious to say after stating the numbers above, but religion is hugely important to everyday Greeks and you would be astronomically 
                    unwise to chastise or otherwise speak ill of Christianity while in the country. Despite the overwhelming Christian majority, the Greek constitution 
                    also certifies religious freedom for all, so you don't have to feel pressured when visiting the country as a member of a differing faith. Indeed, the 
                    Greeks are for more likely to want to learn more about you and what you believe than chastise you for thinking differently. This is the land of 
                    philosophers, after all...
                </p>
                <p>
                    That being said, it would be wise to follow the advice of talking about religion only if the other person brings it up first. Even then, remember where 
                    you are and what your conversation partner most likely believes.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    The dress sense, like the people, is very laid back. You certainly won't be judged by your appearance in Greece unless you are unkempt and/or dirty. A 
                    typical western European wardrobe will suffice, so don't feel the need to pack your Sunday best. Having said that, Athens tends to follow a more smart-casual 
                    approach, so it would be a good idea to save your better garments for the big city visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that Greece gets extremely hot in the summer, so definitely pack something airy and protective. White linen is a popular choice in Athens during the summer, 
                    so by all means follow suit. Also, remember to pack a good pair of walking shoes, as the famous historical sites' stones (the Acropolis etc) tend to be rather 
                    slippery. Not an etiquette tip by any means, but a bit of advice that might prevent a broken ankle...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike other historically religious places, such as Italy, the dress sense in Greek churches isn't overly strict. Ask a foreigner who has also been to Rome and they'll 
                    tell you that you have to cover your shoulders and knees etc. However, ask a local and they'll tell you that you can wear whatever you like, including brighter 
                    colours. The only caveat is monasteries, which do tend to observe a certain dress code. At such places, covering your shoulders and knees <i>is</i> necessary and 
                    some may even ask women to wear a skirt (often provided) over their trousers. It can sometimes be the case that showing your awareness of the local customs will be 
                    enough for the monk to wave you through with whatever you have on, but certainly don't bank on that happening.

                <p>
                    It is no surprise that Greece didn't invent the modern clock, as time keeping isn't an important part of life here. As mentioned on the Food &amp; Drink tab, 
                    if you are invited to a Greek's home for dinner, you should always turn up at least 30 mins late. The same attitude applies to most other parts of everyday life 
                    (barring work of course), so don't worry being late to meet a friend if you miss a bus, for example. Chances are they still won't be there when you arrive anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elders used to be respected everywhere in Europe, but this has waned in recent years. In Greece, however, respect for your elders is a quintessential 
                    part of the culture. When dining with Greeks, the elder will usually be the guest of honour and you will be expected to show them 
                    every courtesy. To set a good impression in Greece, always offer help to an older person who needs it, whether you know them or not. Picking up 
                    a dropped item or helping someone across a busy road are free, but can hold huge value in the moral code. If you happen to know some Greek, don't be afraid to 
                    strike up a conversation with an older person, especially in more rural towns. They would be more than happy to pass the time talking about their family 
                    and their village.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with elders, family itself is a hugely important concept in Greek culture. It is common to find extended family living under one 
                    roof, though this has waned a little in modern times. If you have an acquaintance in their late twenties, don't be surprised to hear they still live 
                    with their family - flying the nest isn't a huge ambition and even when it does happen, the nest flyer will still be expected to live close to their 
                    family. Needless to say, to think of asking a Greek to do something against their family's wishes is likely very unwise indeed.

                <p>
                    Greek businesses operate according to a traditional hierarchical structure, so keep this in mind when talking to anybody older or in a higher position 
                    than you; while the Greeks are very polite, there is a protocol to follow. Conducting business in Greece can be a bit of performance in itself, as it 
                    can take several meetings for the business chat to actually begin. Allow this to happen naturally, however, as the locals like to get to know their 
                    business partners first before conducting any form of negotiation. Family and culture are great talking points, should you find yourself short of things 
                    to say.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bear in mind that when negotiations actually begin, the Greek penchant for passion and flair will often emerge. Business meetings can often descend into 
                    loud conversations and wild hand gestures. For a lot of cultures, this could easily be construed as aggression, but it is almost never the case at all. 
                    That being said, you will likely have to be quite firm to get your point across, so don't be afraid to give as good as you get!
