                    Greece is a nation fairly known for its cuisine. Even in Western Europe, it isn't unusual to see Greek restaurants in a lot of cities. 
                    While recognised as a food nation, Greek food can be a bit hit-and-miss depending on your taste. You may come unstuck if you dislike 
                    olives and cheese, for example. That being said, the cuisine has many lovers, too, and the people are certainly big eaters. Most meals 
                    are washed down with a local wine or some Ouzo, a strong liquorice flavoured spirit.

                    The signature dishes are Moussaka (aubergine and spiced meat casserole) and Baklava (phyllo pastry with a cinnamon-spiced nut filling).

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: 5-10% of the bill</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in Greek restaurants is acceptable, but not essential. It is typically more expected in tourist hotspots, but even then you won't 
                    be chastised for walking away without leaving something. That said, waiters don't earn a lot of money and it is customary to leave something, 
                    though nothing outrageous. As a rule of thumb for good service, 5-10% of the bill will certainly suffice. It is also customary to leave a few 
                    coins on the table for the person who cleans up, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take note that a service charge is often included or the bill is rounded up when presented to you. In this case, you don't have to leave anything 
                    extra. Also, you will likely see a 'cover charge' added to your bill. This is for water, bread and nibbles brought to your table when you sit down 
                    and often can't be removed from the bill. It typically only amounts to a Euro per person though and doesn't go toward the tip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will often need to ask your waiter for the bill, as eating is not a rushed experience in Greece. With the tip, you could ask your waiter if they 
                    actually receive the money because in some establishments they don't, which means you're just paying more for your food. Tips can be left on the table, 
                    given to the waiter directly or you could instruct your waiter to keep the change when you pay.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in Greece isn't expected at all; you pay for your drink and that's the end of it. If you are receiving table service, 
                    giving a little something would be a nice gesture, however. Not mandatory by any means, but a Euro or two wouldn't go amiss.

                    <strong>- Generally acceptable rate: Round up to the next Euro, though not essential</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The very lax tipping culture in Greece also extends to cafés. It isn't common to see a local leave a tip in a café, but nevertheless, it would be polite to 
                    leave a little something. If they have a tip jar, a few coins in there will suffice. For table service and a good waiter, rounding up the bill to the next 
                    Euro will definitely be enough.

                <p>
                    When toasting in Greece, the word to use is "Yiamas!" (pronounced yah-mas). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                <p>
                    While splitting the bill does exist in Greece, it is certainly most commonly the case that the person who invited the other will foot the bill. That said, it 
                    is polite to ask to pay your way, though know that it will most likely be turned down and it is then rude to insist. When a Greek man dines with a woman, even a friend, 
                    he will almost always offer to pay. You can insist on paying your share, just know that it will likely fall on deaf ears.

                    Perhaps unsurprisingly for a nation known for its cuisine, there is a general standard expected at the dinner table. General household standards may have eased 
                    a bit over time, though the following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Greece, either in their homes or in public 
                    establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>You usually have to ask for your bill in a restaurant. Waiters will never urge you to leave unless it is past closing time</li>
                    <li>If invited to somebody's home for dinner, always arrive late - at least 30 mins. The Greeks like a slow pace of life</li>
                    <li>
                        Greeks are extremely generous hosts who take great pride in serving their guests the best food. Your host will always try to serve you more food and it is somewhat 
                        rude to refuse. If you don't think you'll be able to finish everything on the plate, tell your host as soon as you receive your meal. They may remove some for you or 
                        insist you try your best...
                    </li>
                    <li>You must try to finish everything on your plate and if you would like more food, don't be afraid to ask! Your host will actually be thrilled that you would like more</li>
                    <li>
                        Remember to compliment your host's cooking. Women take great pride in their culinary skills in Greece, so a little compliment will go a very long way. While you're at it, 
                        you should also compliment their home when you arrive. Again, this will likely make their day and it costs you nothing
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If invited to somebody's home, stay late, eat more or do whatever the host asks. Their hospitality is sincere and if you're asked to stay later, it will never be meant 
                        as a mere pleasantry
                    </li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, wait for the most important person to start before you do. This will either be the oldest person at the table or the most honoured guest</li>
                    <li>The host will always sit in the middle of the table, not at the head as in a lot of other cultures</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands on/above the table at all times, not just when eating</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Use your cutlery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>...although bear in mind that the Greeks like to eat with their hands a lot, too</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>Be prepared to take your time! Eating in Greece is almost ceremonial and nobody likes to rush the experience</li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is good practice to bring a gift. Either expensive wine or local pastries work very well</li>
                    <li>You won't receive a plate for your bread, nor any butter (as it is used to mop up spare sauce). Just leave it on the rim of your dinner plate or on the table</li>
                    <li>
                        A host will always keep your wine or Ouzo glass topped up and it is near impossible to successfully refuse more. If you don't wish for any more, keep your glass at least half full. 
                        Bear in mind that Ouzo is rather strong, so sips are advised as opposed to downing the glass and receiving more immediately
                    </li>
