                    The home of democracy and modern civilisation as we know it, Greece is perhaps the largest contributor to Western society out of the 
                    plethora of cultures and countries that make the region up. A proud nation with a very proud history spanning many thousands of years, 
                    the Greeks are responsible for most major facets of society and concepts of statehood. The country remains an archaeologist's and 
                    tourist's dream alike.

                    The Greeks are hugely social and welcoming. Whether visiting an area you know well or going for the first time, you'll likely be met with enthusiastic 
                    hospitality. Aside from their grand hospitable nature, the Greeks are also very laid back, so it would certainly be wise to follow suit; if you have 
                    any demons in the closet, leave them at home. Greetings are also very important - a firm hand shake with men, women and even children is expected. Friends 
                    will often hug and kiss on the cheeks.

                    Personal space and restraint in conversation are two major areas that may conflict with you, depending on where you are from. Don't be alarmed if somebody 
                    touches you during conversation, it is just the way the people are. As for conversation, definitely expect to be asked personal questions within moments of 
                    meeting someone for the first time. There are many cultures that perceive this as rude, but please keep in mind that in Greece this is, in fact, the opposite 
                    of rude - it is seen as a way to get to know somebody better, without needless formality. Questions like, "Are you married?" and "Do you have children?" will 
                    be the most commonly asked things, so just answer them as if you were talking to an old friend. You will certainly be treated as such in return.

                    An important note about body language! When it comes to speaking with one's hands, the Italians usually take the top spot, but the Greeks aren't far behind. 
                    If you don't usually speak with your hands, it may help if you indulge a little while here. However, the <i>most</i> important thing to remember is that the 
                    body language you're used to likely won't work in Greece and in some cases it can be highly rude! The 'OK' sign, for example, is rather universal in its meaning. 
                    However, in Greece it is considered very offensive indeed (akin to flipping someone off). So, if you wish to convey acknowledgement, use the trusty thumbs up, 
                    which is acceptable here. Also, nodding your head in agreement or shaking it for disagreement will likely be misunderstood. The Greeks tend to voice their agreement 
                    rather than show it, but when they do, they give a small downwards inclination of the head and that's it. For disagreement, they give a sharp backwards nod of the head. 
                    Definitely keep body language in mind when visiting Greece, as much of the world tends to follow the same unwritten rules and gestures.

                    While generally laid back, the Greeks are a passionate bunch. Relationships and families remain rather traditional here, which is echoed in the 
                    dating scene. Fortunately, it seems the Greeks have a fondness for foreigners! A foreign woman in a bar is far more likely to be approached by a 
                    local man than a Greek woman would be. If you find yourself dating a Greek, expect to be showered with compliments about your appearance, your accent 
                    and perhaps your homeland. We weren't kidding when we said they were welcoming...

                <p>
                    "Meeting the friends will make or break the relationship", or so the old saying goes. Nowhere is it more true than in Greece. If things are going well, 
                    after a few dates you may be brought to meet the <i>Parea</i> - the best friends. This may be a mix of men and women, lifelong friends and university 
                    friends etc, but know that gaining their approval is essential. If the <i>Parea</i> don't like you, you can probably start looking for that proverbial 
                    other fish in the sea.
