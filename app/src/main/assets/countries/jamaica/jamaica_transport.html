                    Jamaica offers a public transport network system heavily reliant on various forms of bus service. There are larger, air conditioned 
                    services in the city and smaller private services that connect virtually every village with the closest town. Public transport is very 
                    cheap indeed, though is also known for having a criminal element if you're not careful. Tips about that below.

                    Though tipping has become somewhat commonplace in Jamaica these days (in the tourist areas at least), this doesn't really apply to taxis. You are 
                    free to offer a small amount (such as rounding up the bill) if your driver has helped with luggage etc, but typically you can safely forego tipping 
                    altogether. This is, of course, entirely down to your discretion.

                    A safety tip about taxis: there is a presence of unlicensed taxis offering services in Jamaica. Sadly, the people who fall prey to this scam 
                    often end up robbed, raped or worse. Fortunately, there is a way to keep yourself safe without avoiding taxis altogether. Licensed vehicles (either 
                    minibuses or taxis) will have a red number/license plate with the letters PPV on it (Public Passenger Vehicle). These are fully licensed and legitimate 
                    public transport services. There are also buses displaying the JUTA insignia (Jamaica Union of Travellers Association). These are exclusively for tourists and also 
                    legitimate. If in doubt, ask the hotel concierge about taxi firms in the area.

                <p>
                    <b>NEVER</b> get into a minibus or taxi without the red license plate displaying the PPV logo.

				<p>
                    Public transport often gets very crowded in Jamaica and the poor condition of the roads means a typical bus ride can be akin to riding 
                    a small rollercoaster at times. The crowding and natural movement also gives petty thieves ample opportunity to snatch a phone or wallet 
                    without you realising, so be sure to keep your belongings hidden away, preferably under clothing.
                </p>

                    Bus journeys often prove to be a great opportunity to get to know some locals. If you're taking a longer journey, inevitably you will end 
                    up talking to the person next to you, as well as the people around you. Don't shy away from this as it's a great chance to experience a genuine 
                    side of Jamaica outisde of the tourist bubble. Contrary to expectation for such a hot country, not all buses have air conditioning and in the summer during 
                    busy periods, it can get very uncomfortable. Think of your fellow passengers and make sure you wear deodorant...

                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, as seating 
                    will be at a premium dueing busy periods. Do the right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. You are representing your 
                    country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will leave a positive impression on the locals. As we mentioned 
                    on the Culture tab, Jamaicans appreciate good manners and have a great respect for elders. Being a little selfless is free, but can 
                    pay moral dividends.
