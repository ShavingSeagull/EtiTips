                    Ya Mon! Jamaican culture is filled with tradition, song, dance, good food and good drink. If there is one place that should come to mind 
                    when you think of somewhere to take a load off and enjoy life for a while, it should be Jamaica. With a much slower pace of life and a bright 
                    culture to explore, you should definitely take the time to see everything this colourful island has to offer.

                    The official language is English (though the national language is Jamaican Creole) and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Jamaica is majority Christian, with a massive 70% of the population identifying with the faith, the vast majority of the Protestant branch. The 
                    second highest affiliation is non-religious, coming in at only 21% of the populace, showing that, unlike much of the rest of western world, 
                    the younger generations are not moving away from religious affiliations. Jamaica is, of course, home to the world famous Rastafari movement, though 
                    in reality this is in the vast minority compared to traditional Christianity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Take note that Jamaicans tend to be deeply religious and any speaking against Christianity will be one of the fastest ways to make yourself hugely 
                    unpopular very quickly. Through this deep religious connection, a strong sense of traditionalism has arisen. Issues that are decried by the faith, such 
                    as homosexuality and abortion are extremely frowned upon, so do be careful what you say within earshot of the locals here. It is usually a good idea to 
                    stay away from religion in conversation, but the old unwritten rule really does apply in Jamaica. If you're Christian or friendly to the faith, attend a 
                    Sunday service - you won't be likely to forget it anytime soon!

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    Imagine a rainbow colliding with the sun and you'll have an idea about Jamaican dress. It is bright, it is colourful and it is loud. Truly, there is little 
                    in your wardrobe that would be garish enough to draw stares here. The women will often wear a headdress, while the dresses are usually handmade and very 
                    striking. Rastafarians tend to place a large amount of value in clothing made from natural fibres (such as hemp), though again, colour is king. Be aware, though, 
                    that showing every bit of flesh when you're not on the beach won't set a good impression. The people are traditional, after all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whatever you decide to pack (the brighter the better!), make sure it's cool, airy and light in colour. Jamaica is a tropical country with a climate to match, so 
                    the weather gets very hot very often. Account for this by packing appropriately and don't forget the sunblock!

                <p>
                    If you're planning on sticking to a tight schedule in Jamaica, you're going to be in for a rude awakening. The pace of life is much slower than 
                    most other places and the people won't rush for anything. If you're invited to do anything with locals, don't expect them to turn up on time and 
                    you shouldn't be too worried about doing so either.
                </p>

                    Family is important to Jamaicans, with elders being revered above all others. Mothers will often act as matriarchs, keeping the kids in line while looking after 
                    the home and the family at large. If you find yourself in conversation or invited to an event with locals (and you likely will at some point), it would be a good 
                    idea to praise the home and show respect to everyone, the older folks in particular. If they want to talk (and they will), lend an ear and smile. Jamaicans are 
                    social people and holiday makers can often find themselves drawn into some party or another. This can be a bit alien depending on where you're from, but definitely 
                    go with it - the locals will likely show you an evening you'll never forget.

                <p>
                    Conducting business in Jamaica is often rather different from the everyday side of the culture. While the locals are social and warm, don't be surprised if at first your business 
                    associate seems a little cold or 'standoffish' - they will warm to you in time, so it is important to set the right impression. As we mentioned on the Social tab, Jamaicans speak 
                    in a direct manner, so be sure to reciprocate; they don't like those who beat around the bush. Haggling is a big part of life in Jamaica, from buying food to negotiating in the 
                    boardroom. While generally a wise approach for negotiations anyway, you certainly shouldn't lead with your best offer. Come in high and be prepared to be knocked down a bit, as well 
                    as reciprocating in kind - bargaining will be a given here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jamaicans value manners and politeness, so arrive on time (even though they likely won't) and keep things formal. This can be easy to forget when you hear your counterpart's colleagues 
                    call him 'Bossman', but this is a common term of respect and not a slang title. Once your Jamaican cohort knows you better, they will likely offer for you to address them by their first 
                    name and the formalities will be dispensed with somewhat. Meetings may take place over lunch or dinner, but make sure you wait until after eating to discuss business - eating time is for 
                    eating. Meetings will also typically start with some small-talk, rather than launching straight into business dealings. This is a great time to show your personality and win them over.
