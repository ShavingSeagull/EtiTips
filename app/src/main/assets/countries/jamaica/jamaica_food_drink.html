                    Jamaica, while not one of the world's leading culinary names, has certainly made an impact in the West over the last few years with 
                    the rise of popularity in Jerk Chicken, one of the country's signature dishes. Perhaps better known for their alcohol, Jamaica (along 
                    with the rest of the Caribbean) are responsible for the ample supply and varying selection of rum in the world today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Jerk Chicken (spiced chicken) and Kidney Bean Soup (also called Red Pea Soup).

                <p>
                    Tipping is a bit hit-and-miss in Jamaica. It should be noted that the locals don't tend to engage in tipping much at all, hence why 
                    we start the generally accepted rate at 0% of the bill. If you're eating somewhere outside of the tourist areas, it will be fine not to 
                    leave anything extra. However, tourist hotspots have become popular for tipping and the staff will expect something from foreigners in these 
                    places. In such cases, 10-15% of the bill will suffice. It should be noted that some restaurants will include a service charge, but not all will 
                    show it on the bill. It is always a good idea to ask if there are any charges included and, if there are, whether they actually go to the 
                    server or not. Sadly, it is not always the case. Don't leave any extra if a charge is applied that goes to your waiter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important tip for all-inclusive resorts! Virtually every all-inclusive hotel forbids their staff from accepting tips or gifts from guests. So 
                    much so, that some hotels will actually fire staff caught accepting tips. If you're staying all-inclusive, don't leave a tip for any of the services there. 
                    You'll honestly be more a hinderance than a help by trying to be nice.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in Jamaica isn't expected at all. You can always round up the bill to the nearest Dollar if you wish, 
                    but it isn't an expected custom. If you are receiving table service, giving a little something might be a nice gesture. Not mandatory 
                    by any means, but a couple of Dollars wouldn't go amiss. Again, leaving something in a tip jar is more advised if drinking in a tourist 
                    area.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike with restaurants, there is no expectation to tip at cafés in Jamaica. Most people will just stop off for a coffee, which absolutely doesn't 
                    require you leave anything, even if sitting at a table. Note, that leaving a little something certainly wouldn't be rude, it just isn't expected. 
                    If you received particularly good service, feel free to leave a couple of Dollars if you wish.

                    When toasting in Jamaica, the word to use is, of course, "Cheers!". If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                    It is always polite to offer to split the bill, though if your dinner friends insist to pay, don't get into an argument about it and concede defeat. 
                    If you are a man taking a woman to dinner, you should always be expecting to foot the bill at the end of the night.

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, though this is often rather informal. General household standards may have eased 
                    a bit over time, though the following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Jamaica, either in their homes or in public 
                    establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, wait for the most important person to start eating before you do. This will either be the host or the oldest person at the table</li>
                    <li>You can safely put your hands in your lap when not eating. It isn't rude here</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Use your cutlery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>Jamaicans tend to eat buffet style. Try to give everything on the table a try as this shows graciousness</li>
                    <li>Do try to empty your plate if you can. Again, this will display graciousness</li>
                </ul>
