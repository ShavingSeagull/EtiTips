                    Jamaica has a long history dating back to the colonial era and beyond. Gaining independence from the United Kingdom 
                    in only 1962, Jamaica has since moved on to become a tourist hotspot and a major influencer on western culture, with 
                    singers like Bob Marley introducing the popular Reggae style of music to the world and sports stars such as Usain Bolt 
                    changing the athletics scene forever.

                    Jamaicans are as social as they are traditional. Walking down a rural road and failing to greet a passerby will result in a very sour 
                    impression indeed. Likewise, a greeting should always be offered to shop staff when enquiring something of them or upon entering, if it's 
                    a small store. A firm handshake for two men will do the trick, while women often greet with a kiss on the cheek, starting with the right. As 
                    with a lot of other places, men will get more physical with each other, such as pats on the shoulder etc, when they're more familiarly acquainted 
                    or if they're related.

                    Titles are still widely used in Jamaica, especially with older people. You should always address someone as Mr, Mrs or Miss until invited to use their 
                    first name; don't do so before they say you can. Elders are held in high regard in Jamaican society, so using titles and maintaining respect toward 
                    older people is absolutely essential, as well.

                    Contrary to what you may be used to - depending on where you're from - Jamaicans tend to be rather direct. If they're thinking it, they'll probably 
                    say it. If you've got a big nose or no hair, don't be surprised if this becomes the butt of a joke. It may be easy to take offence to things like that, 
                    but it's best just laughed off and dealt with by engaging in some self-deprecating humour. Also, be sure to maintain eye contact when conversing with 
                    the locals. They view people with shifty eyes as suspicious, which is probably not an impression you want to set!

                    A note for women travelling alone: Expect a lot of...attention from the local men. Following the point above about directness, Jamaican men will make it 
                    very clear that they find you attractive. This can range from cheesy chat-up lines to full-blown pornographic suggestions. Some women come to Jamaica with 
                    the intention of finding an 'exotic lover', which has exacerbated the issue. Avoid eye contact, dress conservatively and be firm in your refusal, should you 
                    wish to avoid the propositions somewhat.

                    As stated above, women will find no problem gaining the attention of the locals. Men will typically find it harder to impress the local ladies, though it 
                    isn't impossible. In either case, be sure to dress well and look presentable. For the men, taking charge and leading the date will make you attractive to 
                    Jamaican women, as they value traditional masculinity.

                    A warning for same-sex couples: Homosexuality is illegal in Jamaica and the population is rather religious. You don't need to avoid the country if you're 
                    gay, but you must ensure you don't publicise it. A lot of gay men own and/or work in the hotels in Jamaica, so asking for a double room won't be impossible, 
                    though under no circumstance should you engage in any form of public affection whatsoever. Even talking about homosexuality is a very risky idea here. Responses 
                    from the locals can range from disgust, arguments or ridicule, to threats and beatings.

                        Leave your big girl pants at home if you're travelling to Jamaica as a solo woman. You will need to stand up for yourself 
                        against the very forward local men
