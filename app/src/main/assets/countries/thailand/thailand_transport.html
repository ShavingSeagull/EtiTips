                    Thailand has a decent public transport system, boasting bus, rail, metro, the unique SkyTrain and the beloved Tuk Tuk. The SkyTrain and 
                    metro network only covers Bangkok, however, but provides a highly valuable way of avoiding the extremely bad traffic that often occurs in 
                    the city. The rail system is a little sparse, though can be used to reach Cambodia and Malaysia!

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with most other services, tipping isn't really expected, though unlike other services, it isn't really necessary to indulge in the 
                    practice anyway. The reason for this is that most taxi drivers will simply round up the fare to the nearest Baht anyway, thus gifting 
                    themselves some small change in the process. The bonus to this is that it means you get to avoid having to drag around pockets of 
                    useless small change all day.

                    Bonus tip for taxis! Make sure the taxi driver has switched the meter on before departing. If he tries to agree a fixed price with you 
                    beforehand, simply find another taxi because you'll end up paying far more than you should. If the driver doesn't speak English, simply 
                    point to the meter if it's off. For other methods of transport that obviously don't have meters, such as Tuk Tuks and motorcycles (yes, 
                    they can serve as a taxi service here, too!), a price will always have to be agreed before you depart. Do take into account, especially 
                    with Tuk Tuks, that the driver will almost certainly overcharge you if you're foreign. A way around this is to ask your hotel beforehand 
                    what the expected fare should be for the journey you intend to undertake; that should prevent you getting ripped off. That said, public 
                    transport is very cheap in Thailand, so even if you do get overcharged, it's not likely to break tha bank.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour on Thai public transport reflects the standard of behaviour you see from them in everyday life. Typically, you can expect 
                    a pleasant journey surrounded by friendly locals. Do take into account, however, that Thailand is a very hot, humid country and not all forms of 
                    transport are air conditioned, meaning some journeys, especially those longer in duration and/or during peak hours, could get very uncomfortable. 
                    Be sure to apply a good deodorant before you leave the hotel!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to give up your seat to somebody vulnerable, such as the elderly or the disabled. Given how respected elders are in Thai society, 
                    you will be setting a massively positive example by doing so. Remember that you are representing your country when you go abroad, so be sure to 
                    conduct yourself properly, as it will not only make your time in Thailand easier, but also those who follow you.
