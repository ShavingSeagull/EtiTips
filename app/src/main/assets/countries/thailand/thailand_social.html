                    Formerly known as Siam, Thailand is a nation that was first established in a proper context by migrants from China in the 11th century. While being a very popular 
                    choice for tourists due to its inexpensive food, drink and amenities, Thailand has actually risen to become hugely developed and has the second strongest economy in 
                    South East Asia. Tha nation has lived through several exchanges of power - some forced, some not - but has since maintained a peaceful balance for many years.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    For many Westerners, Thailand would be viewed as 'traditional' in the sense that the West used to hold similar values which have sinced changed. One of 
                    these concepts is that of 'face'. Thai behaviour is dictated almost entirely by this concept of respect and not losing face, so to speak. It is for this reason that it is very 
                    unlikely for a local to do or say something that would make you look foolish or unfavoured in public. Likewise, you should do the same! To discredit someone in public in Thailand 
                    would be a major faux-pas and highly disrespectful. This goes hand-in-hand with remaining calm in almost any situation, another concept the Thai people have mastered over their 
                    many years of societal existence. No matter what the issue is, whether something has gone awry or the language barrier is proving very frustrating in a difficult situation 
                    (which is understandable), you should always make an effort to remain calm and deal with things in a collected manner - your local counterparts certainly will and won't appreciate 
                    it whatsoever if you make a scene or a spectacle of yourself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Generally speaking, the Thai people are very laid-back and easy-going. There is even a local phrase, <i>mai-bpen-rai</i>, that translates as "don't worry about it" - think of it as the 
                    Thai version of Hakuna Matata! The country is predominantly Buddhist, which may explain the desire not to hold on to stress or negative emotion. Whatever the underlying reason may be, it 
                    certainly makes for a pleasant travelling experience for the humble foreigner. Keep in mind, however, that you should look to emulate the local behaviour, too, as rolling through town 
                    with the (potentially) abrupt, direct, forceful nature that you may be used to back home, will make you deeply unpopular in record quick time. When in Bangkok, do as the Thais do.
                </p>
                <p>
                    OK, so you've got the general behaviour understood, what about body language? That's fairly straight-forward. Thais, like most East Asians, are not touchers by a long shot. Not that you'd be 
                    likely to touch everyone you meet anyway, but touching someone in conversation, such as a pat on the back, would be a very alien concept here and seen as uncomfortable. There is an even more 
                    important addendum to this - touching somebody's head. In short, <b>DON'T</b>! The head is a sacred area for Buddhists and should never be touched by anybody who isn't extremely close to the 
                    recipient. Again, it's hardly likely you'd be touching somebody's head unless you knew them very well to start with, but it's still an important point to make. Aside from bodily contact and 
                    a respect for personal space, the other golden rule is not to point. Pointing can be interpreted as rude in many nations and in many contexts, but it is especially rude here. If you need to 
                    point to something, such as giving directions, use an open palm that is facing downwards. It should be noted that pointing to something on a page or a menu, for example, is obviously fine. 
                    Finally, a word on greetings. The traditional Thai greeting involves putting the hands together in a prayer motion (as the Indians do when they say "Namaste") and giving a slight bow. This 
                    greeting isn't expected of foreigners, but by all means don't be afraid to greet people in the local manner! It may not be expected, but that's not to say it won't be hugely appreciated!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A note on English speaking: unlike many countries in East Asia, Thailand has a decent number of English speakers. That's not to say that all of those speakers are fluent to any degree, but 
                    you should find no problems getting by if you speak English here. Naturally, you'll find the highest concentration of English speakers in the tourist areas and less in more rural areas. 
                    Either way, make use of the common Thai words below, as making that little extra effort can be hugely rewarding to your experience in Thailand.
                </p>

				<hr class="line" style="width: 90px;" />
				<p>
                    Dating in Thailand is a far more serious affair than in the West. While the concept of arranged marriage isn't practiced here, the view of dating to find a husband/wife most certainly is. 
                    Physical intimacy (in most forms) won't take place until the relationship nears a stage of marriage. That's not to say you can't find people willing to do the opposite here, but bear in 
                    mind they won't hold the traditional Thai view and are very unlikely to be looking for a serious relationship; if you are, there could be obvious conflicts of interest. If you are looking to 
                    meet a local for love, plan to be in it for the long haul.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for couples coming to Thailand on holiday, the rules are pretty simple - keep those hands and lips where we can see them! Couples falling over each other at every given 
                    opportunity will not be looked on favourably whatsoever, so keep private moments to private places. A note for same-sex couples: again, differing from many East Asian countries, Thailand 
                    has been famed in recent years for its open culture in regards to homosexuality etc. Local people can find some push-back from the law in regards to equal rights, but travellers tend to 
                    experience the opposite, often choosing Bangkok as their destination because of its liberal attitude with regards to non-heterosexual relations.

                <h3 class="section-header">Useful Words</h3>
                <p>
                        Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting Thailand. Learning a few could also help you make a good impression on the 
                        locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses ().
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li><b>สวัสดีครับ / สวัสดีค่ะ</b> (sa-wa-dee-khap / sa-wa-dee-kha) - <i>Good morning/good evening</i>. The left example is what a man should say and the right version is what a woman should say.</li>
                    <li><b>ขอบคุณ</b> (khop-khun) - <i>Thank you</i>. Important to learn this one, as Thais are generally very polite.</li>
                    <li><b>ขอ</b> (khor) - <i>Please</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>สวัสดี</b> (sa-wa-dee) - <i>Hello</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>ลาก่อนนะ</b> (la-gon-na) - <i>Goodbye</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>Bye bye</b> (bye bye) - <i>Bye</i>. A lot of Thais have adopted the English phrase "bye bye", so you can actually use that, too! Just make sure you say it twice instead of once, as we usually would in English.</li>
                    <li><b>ใช่</b> (chai) - <i>Yes</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>ไม่</b> (mai) - <i>No</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>ขอโทษ</b> (kaw-toht) - <i>Sorry</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>ขอโทษ</b> (kaw-toht) - <i>Excuse me</i>. The same as above. Useful when you want to pass someone by on the street.</li>
                    <li><b>พูดอังกฤษได้ไหม</b> (poot ang-grit dai mai) - <i>Can you speak English?</i>.</li>
