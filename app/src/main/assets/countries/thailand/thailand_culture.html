                    Perhaps owing to the nation's name changes over the years, many people don't realise how old Thailand's culture is. Having been settled by the ethnic Tai People in the 11th century, 
                    Thailand's culture has become a blend of traditional Oriental values, such as those held in China, while also being interspersed with influence from places like India. The result is a 
                    country famed for its hospitable people, its typically Buddhist easy-going values and its love of family.

                    The official language is Thai and the national religion is Buddhism.

                <p>
                    While the state technically doesn't list an official religion for Thailand, making religious freedom guaranteed, there is no doubt that the national faith is Buddhism - the Theravada branch 
                    specifically. A massive 94.5% of the population identify as Buddhists, with Islam coming in at second place with a following of just 4.3%, largely due to the Malay population in the south of 
                    the country. Buddhist holidays are observed in Thailand and alcohol is forbidden from being sold on these days, both in shops and bars. Plan that party trip to the beach wisely!

                    Conducting yourself well in Thailand with regards to religion is perhaps a little easier than in some other parts of the World, as the locals are very forgiving by nature. Wherever you are though, 
                    it is never wise to start religious debates with the locals, as they rarely end well. If you do happen to talk about religion to a Thai, don't be surprised if they smile and seem to agree 
                    with you - this is the concept of saving face, in this case, yours; they may be smiling, but they're likely disagreeing with you silently. By all means indulge in the local faith and definitely 
                    take the opportunity to visit the Buddhist holy sites and, if you're feeling extra brave, consider getting a Sak Yant tattoo. These are Buddhist tattoos created by monks who dictate the design 
                    you will receive and where it will go on your body based on your spiritual energy. They do this practically for free, too; a small donation in the form of cigarettes of local snacks is all that is 
                    usually required for them to perform the Sak Yant. After completing the tattoo with a traditional device, it is then blessed to allow you to benefit from its intended purpose. Considering people 
                    have tattoos of everything these days and later regret it, why not have one that actually has huge meaning? How many people outside Thailand can say they have a tattoo created and performed by a senior 
                    Buddhist monk?

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    Thais generally like to dress well, as a respectable appearance gives 'face'. This doesn't mean you need to pack the Armani jacket you saved all year for (the dress sense itself is fairly casual), just 
                    ensure that your appearance is neat and tidy. Businesses refusing (with a disguised excuse) to serve people who turn up sweaty and haggard is not unheard of, so be sure to keep yourself presentable! There 
                    is a class system in Thailand, which also dictates the way people dress. This won't come into play for tourists so much, but be aware that a person will dress to suit both the occasion, but also their 
                    financial status. Whatever you wear, it's best to keep it fairly modest.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business dress is rather typical, with shirts, ties and trousers being the order of the day. That said, owing to the often stifling heat, jackets are usually reserved for evening wear or higher ranking 
                    executives, who will often sacrifice comfort for status and 'face'. For ladies, ensure that whatever you're wearing to work has sleeves. There is nothing against a woman showing her arms in everyday life, 
                    but it's best to cover them at work.

                <p>
                    In Thailand, family is everything. There are many countries that follow this approach, with much of the Middle East and the Latin countries of 
                    Europe and South America also placing huge importance on the family unit. Folks from the West would likely describe the typical Thai family unit 
                    as 'traditional', though all this means in reality is that they operate the same way Western families did a few decades ago. In practice, this means 
                    the father will go out to work hard to provide for his family, while the mother will maintain the house and raise the children. It is sometimes the case 
                    that the mothers will have to work, too, though it is the desire of every Thai man to be in a position where he can provide for his family alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also a part of the family unit are elders, who will typically live with their families. In fact, it's normal to see three generations living under one roof in 
                    Thailand! Elders are hugely, hugely respected here and it is <b>never</b> a good idea to do or say anything that would cause offence or embarrassment for an older 
                    person. They start eating first, they enter rooms first and they take pole position at any important event, bar a wedding of course. If you are in a 
                    relationship with a local and wish to make a good impression on their families, do everything you can to show respect to the elders. Actions speak louder than 
                    words, especially in East Asian cultures, so don't let the language barrier stop you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The official name of the country is actually The Kingdom of Thailand and under <b>NO</b> circumstance should you criticize the royal family, who are hugely respected by many 
                    Thais. It's not just to avoid offending the locals that you should refrain from speaking ill of the royals - it's actually a crime to do so. Your mother probably raised you under the 
                    adage of "If you have nothing nice to say then say nothing at all". Well, when it comes to the royal family, it's best to just not speak of them altogether, nice platitudes or not. 
                    You only need one thing to be lost in translation while trying to speak well of the royals to land yourself in hot water. In the same vein, even though you're a foreigner, you should 
                    stand for the Thai national anthem if you hear it playing. It isn't uncommon to see it played before a film starts in a cinema, so follow the locals' lead and stand to attention!

                <p>
                    Conducting business in Thailand can be extremely slow at times. There are a number of reasons for this. Primarily, any decision has to filter through the various levels of hierarchy first, 
                    which can take an age. Secondarily, the locals just prefer to take their time with such matters. It is for these reasons that a rushed approach should absolutely be avoided here, as it will 
                    likely result in relations breaking down altogether. Always prepare for a proposal or negotiation to take several meetings before things really get going. The first meeting will almost always 
                    be centred around getting to know one another and not much else. The second meeting will typically be based around a meal. Regardless of how many meetings you've had, they will always start 
                    with small talk and initiating business discussions immediately will be considered rude. Patience will be a virtue here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with much of the rest of East Asia, business cards still hold a lot of importance, so be sure to have some made specially, with Thai on one side and English on the other. Always offer the card 
                    with the Thai side facing up. When receiving your counterpart's card, take a moment to read it and give a positive comment on it: this could be a remark on its design or the convenient location of 
                    the office etc. As for greetings, this can be murky waters for foreigners. Typically, Thais will use the local <i>Wai</i> greeting we mentioned on the Social tab, where the hands are pushed together in 
                    a prayer motion at chest height and a slight bow of the head is given. A lot of locals, especially in business settings, will likely expect a foreigner to shake hands, however. The golden rule to navigating 
                    this mini minefield is to simply wait and allow your counterpart to offer the greeting first, then simply reciprocate what they do - if they extend their hand, simply shake it; if they perform the <i>Wai</i> 
                    greeting, do the same. Typically, the junior will offer the <i>Wai</i> first before the senior reciprocates, but as you'll likely be meeting someone of equal authority, this shouldn't be an issue. If you're feeling 
                    brave, you could offer the traditional <i>Wai</i> greeting immediately, thus showing respect to the local culture (and giving a good impression right off the bat), while also showing respect for your counterpart's 
                    authority. As a quick aside, the height of your hands during the <i>Wai</i> denotes the level of respect you are giving: the standard greeting will be at chest height; conveying extra respect will have the hands higher, 
                    but <b>never</b> past eye level. If you're meeting someone of equal authority to you, it's best to keep them at chest height.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One final note about social interaction in negotiations (which also applies to everyday life): Thais use laughter and smiling as a mechanism to show and deal with embarrassment, as well as the traditional uses of those 
                    interactions, of course. If you're in conversation with your counterpart and you notice them laugh for seemingly no reason, try and change the subject - they are embarrassed. Likewise, you can use this mechanism, too, 
                    if you feel embarrassed during conversation. Your counterpart will likely take the hint and change the subject to avoid you losing 'face'.
