                    Thai cuisine may not be quite as famous as its not-too-distant neighbour, China's, but it has still gained huge popularity in the rest of the World, especially in the West. Dishes 
                    like Pad Thai and Thai Curry have become staples for foreigners who wish to indulge in an exotic taste, with the frequent use of spice being a huge winner for foreign taste buds. 
                    Even most Chinese restaurants in Western countries provide a few Thai options on their menus now, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Pad Thai (fried noodles with shrimp or chicken) and Guay Teow (various types of noodle soup).

                    <strong>- Generally acceptable rate (expensive establishments): At least 10% of the bill</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in East Asia is generally a no-no, but Thailand differs slightly. Tipping here is never really expected, though is always appreciated, as serving staff 
                    typically don't earn a lot of money for what they do. This is in contrast to somewhere like China, where it can often be rude to tip. The general rule-of-thumb 
                    is that if you're eating in a cheaper or middle-range restaurant, just leave your small change at the end; for an upper class establishment, leave at least 10% 
                    of the bill and this will actually be expected, as the waiters in such restaurants will be professionals. In either case, you should always leave the tip in 
                    cash and give it to the waiter directly, as card-paid tips or tips given to managers may not make it to the servers. If you were served by a team of serving staff, 
                    give the tip to the head waiter and tell them who the tip is to be shared among.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may encounter a service charge in more expensive restaurants. In this case, there is no need to leave anything extra on top, as the charge will be at least 10% 
                    anyway.

                <p>
                    Again, tips are not expected in bars, so don't feel the need to leave one. If there is a tip jar on the counter, it may be a nice gesture to leave a few coins in there though, 
                    especially if your barman/barmaid gave great, friendly service.

                <p>
                    The general rate above is for cafés as well as small street-corner eateries. In venues like these, simply rounding up the bill to the nearest Baht is perfectly acceptable 
                    and any more won't be necessary.

                <p>
                    When toasting in Thailand, the word to use is "ไชโย" (pronounced "chai-yo"). Many countries in East Asia have a rigid drinking culture that focuses on keeping 
                    up with everyone else, lest you 'lose face'. Thais tend to approach the concept from the opposite direction - they let you mix your own cocktails and drinks so that 
                    you can keep them to your own level of natural alcohol tolerance, thus avoiding a situation where you could 'lose face'. Definitely an easier time for foreigners, 
                    especially those here on business, who would typically wish to avoid a situation where they could 'lose face' in front of their local counterparts at all costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If clinking glasses, it is customary to bring seniority into it. If you're clinking with somebody older or higher in authority than you, touch the rim of your 
                    glass to a place lower than the rim of theirs, such as half-way down. This shows you acknowledge the difference in seniority and is a sign of respect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One last important note is that you should never fill your own cup in Thailand - that is the job of your neighbour. Likewise, it is your responsibility to keep 
                    your neighbour's glass filled, too. If you are filling one glass, it is polite to top-off everyone else's, too.
                </p>

                <hr class="line" style="width: 130px;"/>
                <p>
                    Splitting the bill isn't unheard of in Thailand and many restaurants will actually ask when you sit down who is paying together and who is paying separately. This 
                    can also function as a great way to find out what the other people on the table are intending to do vis-a-vis paying for the meal! Do note, however, that if you have 
                    been invited out for a meal, you shouldn't offer to split the bill - inviting somebody to dinner in Thailand denotes that you will pay for the meal as well. Offering 
                    to split the bill after being invited out for a meal would be rude. Simply reciprocate the gesture in the future, which would also serve to 'gain face' - a win-win!
                </p>
                <p>
                    One last thing: if you're the oldest person at the table, you will be expected to pay the bill. That's one aspect of the seniority system that is common here!
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Thailand, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Remember to take off your shoes when entering somebody's house!</li>
                    <li>Dishes are served in large communal bowls or plates that everybody takes from. Don't ever order a dish and eat it by yourself</li>
                    <li>Seniority dictates who starts the meal off and this is usually the eldest person at the table. Never begin eating until the guest of honour has started</li>
                    <li>
                        Contrary to popular belief, Thai folks don't use chopsticks anywhere near as much as people believe; chopsticks will only be used for noodles. For everything 
                        else, you will be given a fork and a spoon
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        However, don't put the fork in your mouth! The fork is used in Thailand as the knife is used in the West (in one context) - use it to push food onto your spoon 
                        and eat with that instead
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't eat directly from communal plates. Use the serving spoon or utensil provided to place some of the food onto your plate</li>
                    <li>Eat slowly! The locals treat meals as a time to catch-up with friends and family, so keep pace with those around you</li>
                    <li>There is no need to wait for all the dishes to come to the table before starting to eat</li>
                    <li>
                        You aren't expected to finish everything on your plate, though it isn't rude to do so either. Typically, people will eat until they're full, so it may be wise to take smaller portions 
                        to avoid over-committing and feeling like you have to finish everything when you're full
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If eating with locals, especially at their homes, it is often the case that the youngest members will serve the elders. This means that, as with drinking, somebody will often be putting the 
                        food on your plate. This isn't a certain though and you can, of course, serve yourself. If you do serve yourself, it is polite to serve the person next to you first
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of western cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't speak with your mouth full. Perhaps a little obvious, but it isn't actaully considered rude in some cultures. It is in Thailand, though</li>
                    <li>Don't rest your chin in your hands or put your elbows on the table. It is disrepectful here</li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to wait to be seated. They will likely have a seating plan in mind, which will involve the elders being in the most prominent place</li>
                    <li>It is good manners to bring a small gift if eating at somebody's home. Special expensive teas or a good quality liquor work well</li>
                    <li>It isn't overly common, but you may have to share your table with another party in a restaurant. You're not expected to make conversation - just behave as if you were on separate tables</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
			<div class="container">
				<h4 class="section-header">Do's</h4>
