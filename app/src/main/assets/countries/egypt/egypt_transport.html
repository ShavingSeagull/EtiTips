                    Egypt has a decent public transport system, focused largely on buses. Cairo is the only place with a metro system, which provides an 
                    ideal way to get around the city quickly. There is a rail system, though it is less reliable and best used for long haul journeys 
                    across country.

                    It may be surprising to read, after learning about the vast tipping culture earlier on the Food &amp; Drink tab, that it isn't actually 
                    expected to tip taxi drivers. Naturally, they wouldn't turn the gesture down, but it really isn't necessary unless the driver has gone out of their 
                    way to be extra helpful. If you really must, a few Egyptian Pounds will suffice.

                    While taxis are generally an inexpensive way to travel, it is better to know the expected price beforehand. Many taxi drivers will try to rip you off 
                    by stating their meter is broken or that you can "pay what you want". Agreeing a set price in advance for a car without a meter is the way to go, though don't 
                    do this for short distances as it shows you aren't familiar with the system; save it for longer journeys.

                    Egyptians may be friendly socially, but when it comes to public transport, especially on the Cairo metro, it can be a bit of a free-for-all! 
                    Tickets are bought at the ticket booth and if you plan on standing in line to wait your turn to be served, you better start walking to your 
                    destination now. Metro fares are a standard price, so people will crowd around the booth with their hands out to exchange the coin for the ticket. 
                    It is best to find a gap in the flurry of arms and get yours in, too. If you are a woman, a lot of Egyptian men will be courteous and clear the path 
                    a bit to allow you to purchse a ticket without being groped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When boarding or departing, don't expect people to wait their turn, either. If you are afraid of having to push your way on and off public transport, 
                    it may be wiser to stick to taxis as physical contact will usually be required. The ladies have a reprieve here, however: the Cairo metro has special 
                    carriages marked with a red sign that are female-only. It is definitely recommended to make use of these if you are a solo woman travelling in Egypt.

                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, as seating will be at a premium, especially during busy hours. Do the 
                    right thing and give a helping hand to those in need. You are representing your country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will 
                    leave a positive impression on the locals, especially in a society that reveres its elders so much.

                        Keep your wits about you in busy stations as pickpockets will be present. Take the stairs instead of the escalator, as the 
                        close proximity will make it easier to have all your possessions stolen
