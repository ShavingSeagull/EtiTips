                    Pharaohs, pyramids and the Nile. Easily the three things Egypt is known for the world over, two of which are still around to this day. One 
                    of the oldest surviving civilisations in the world (behind China), Egypt has had an astronomical impact on human history for periods spanning 
                    thousands of years. While enjoying its relative retirement in the present day, the country remains a hugely popular tourist destination.

                <p>
                    Greetings are an important social custom in Egypt. Whether meeting someone for the first time or the hundreth, you are expected to greet them 
                    when you meet and give a farewell when you part ways. When greeting someone, a handshake or a kiss on the cheek is expected - a handshake for men, 
                    kisses on the cheek for women and a handshake for men and women. Note, there are caveats to this that you must be aware of! It is common to see two 
                    men holding hands or kissing on the cheeks when they meet here. Though homosexuality is strictly outlawed in Islam, Muslims also don't believe it really 
                    exists, thus physical affection between men is not out of the ordinary at all. When two men become friends, the handshake will likely evolve to cheek kisses. 
                    The greeting between men and women can also be murky waters. If the woman extends her hand, the man should shake it. However, if she does not, the man should 
                    give a polite bow instead. The woman must extend the hand for a handshake first!

                    Egyptians are a notably warm, friendly people. Hospitality plays a huge part in the daily culture of the people, which we'll cover more over on the Culture tab, 
                    but it is important to be aware of their nature when conducting yourself socially, too. Always pay attention to conduct yourself politely and with good manners here, 
                    as making the wrong move could unwittingly offend the locals, making life harder for you while you're in Egypt and travellers who will follow you in the future. 
                    Certainly, if you behave with respect, the locals will be more than happy to open theirselves and their homes to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Egypt is a Muslim country and so it is important to remember that a clear, strong distinction exists between men and women. Please don't be surprised if, as a woman 
                    with your husband, you ask an Egyptian man a question only to find he answers your husband and not you. This isn't as it may appear on the surface and is done to show 
                    respect to the husband rather than ignorance toward the wife. Likewise, a husband with a wife asking an Egyptian woman a question shouldn't be surprised to find she 
                    answers his wife and not him. It works both ways!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, a word on English speaking: there are a fair number of Egyptians who speak English, but certainly don't expect the level of proficiency you would find from 
                    a European country, for example. Typically, street traders will speak English as they want to promote their wares to foreign tourists. Some traders will also speak French 
                    for the same reason! In cities like Cairo and the tourist areas, you will obviously find a higher number of English speakers; just be aware that you may not be understood 
                    by the majority of people. Speak clearly and speak a little slower than you usually would.

                    Romancing in Egypt has strict rules. If you're here with your partner, you should absolutely refrain from public displays of affection. Egpyt is a conservative country 
                    due to its dominant religion and this must be respected when travelling here, as its rules are upheld with little leniency. Women in particular must be extra vigilant to 
                    behave with respect. Any form of public affection toward a man, even her own husband, will give the locals the impression that she is 'easy'. This is not a look you want to 
                    wear here. Ironically, even if the husband is the one to show affection to the woman, it will be her who is tarred with the 'easy' brush, not him. Not entirely fair, perhaps, 
                    but that's the way it is. Do take note, however, that foreign women can be friendly toward Egyptian men, just keep a very tight handle on it to avoid being seen as something you 
                    likely aren't. Foreign men shouldn't flirt with Egyptian women under any circumstance!

                    An important note for same-sex couples: Egypt is a Muslim country and Islam is most certainly <b>not</b> gay-friendly. When we say you should keep any and all forms of affection 
                    to the privacy of your hotel room, we don't mean you may get a few harsh words thrown at you as you may in your home country. To openly display homosexuality in any Muslim country, 
                    Egypt included, is to risk your safety or, in some places, your life. This doesn't mean Egypt should be avoided, but it does mean you will have to behave with the utmost decorum if 
                    you come here. Naturally, don't broach the subject with any locals, either.

                <p>
                        Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting Egypt. 
                        Learning a few could also help you make a good impression on the locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses (). 
                        Note, Arabic uses a gutteral sound similar to what you may find in Dutch, Welsh or Hebrew. When this sound is needed, we 
                        will write it as 'kh'.
