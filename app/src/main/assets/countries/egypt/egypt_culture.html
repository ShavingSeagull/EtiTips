                    The culture of Egypt is steeped in history and the evolution of human history. Few civilisations are as old or as well established 
                    as Egypt's, with thousands of years of contribution to society and development. In the modern day, Egypt prides itself on family values, 
                    hospitality and friendly social endeavours.

                    The official language is Arabic (though the national language is the Egyptian Arabic dialect) and the official religion is Islam.

                <p>
                    Egypt is majority Muslim, with a massive 85% of the population identifying with the faith, the vast majority with the Sunni branch. The second 
                    highest affiliation is Coptic Christian, coming in at only 15% of the populace. Islam as a religion is also entwined in state affairs, as is the 
                    case with virtually all Muslim nations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Islam has very strict rules that govern many aspects of daily life. This can range from the place of women in society, to what is acceptable to 
                    speak about when discussing the religion itself. There has been a lot of tension between Muslims and non-Muslims in the last couple of decades, so 
                    it is best, if you are a Western tourist, to be extra vigilant in the way you behave while in Muslim countries. Don't be alarmed, however - Egyptians 
                    are friendly and warm people who will be accommodating regardless of where you're from. That said, it would be extremely wise not to engage in discussion 
                    about religion, especially if you are non-religious. Under no circumstance should you talk about the Muslim prophet Mohammed; it is just a subject best 
                    avoided altogether. In many countries, speaking ill of him will cost you your life.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    Egyptians dress conservatively, but like to dress well, as presentation denotes one's status and self worth. Bear in mind that Egypt is a country in 
                    northern Africa, so the average temperature is rather high. Linen trousers and stylish shirts/light jackets will be a good choice here. Ladies are not 
                    required to wear a headscarf, though do keep in mind that displaying too much flesh will be very frowned upon. Covering the shoulders, chest and legs is 
                    a very good idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you intend on visiting religious sites while in Egypt, note that there will be a strict dress code. Both men and women will have to take their shoes off 
                    before entering and women will have to ensure that they cover their flesh even more than usual.

                <p>
                    Family is a hugely important concept in Egyptian culture. Families here tend to be large and they tend to be close, so this is certainly something to 
                    bear in mind if you are dating/marrying a local, for example. Children are important, as are elders, who are held in the highest esteem within Egyptian 
                    society and culture. If you spot an older person in need of help, you should definitely lend a hand as you will be setting an incredibly good impression 
                    with the locals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While not a nation known for its outstanding football/soccer team (sorry, Egypt!), the passion for the sport runs high here. On match days, don't be surprised to see 
                    the streets littered with passionate fans. Indeed, if you're looking for an ice-breaker in conversation with a local man, just bring up football and, if you're aware 
                    of who he is, talk about Mohamed Salah's career. You will likely be stuck in conversation for some time!
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Egyptian businesses don't place huge value on time keeping, with many staff arriving a good thirty minutes after the official starting time. Office spaces also tend to be 
                    open, with employees happy to chat to one another. That being said, if you have business in Egypt, be sure you arrive on time! As is usually the case with time-lax countries, 
                    it is one rule for me and another rule for thee.
                </p>

                    A foreigner in Egypt for business? Take note that business will not usually take place until your Egyptian counterpart decides they like you. The personal side of a working 
                    relationship is hugely important, so do take the time to get to know your cohort first. For many Westerners who are used to the opposite, the slower pace of proceedings may be a 
                    little frustrating, but do persevere as trying to conduct business in a Western fashion will prove futile. When it comes to negotiating, it is wise not to take a hard-sell approach, 
                    though do stay firm in your convictions as the Egyptians tend to be hard bargainers. Take note that voices may become raised during meetings. This is not a sign of aggression, it is merely 
                    the way Egyptians tend to speak, so please don't misconstrue such behaviour. Avoid scheduling meetings on a Thursday and Friday, as this tends to be the weekend in Egypt; Friday 
                    is the Muslim holy day, thus the Thursday usually completes the typical two days off. Also, avoid arranging anything during Ramadan, as businesses will be functioning on a reduced 
                    schedule.
