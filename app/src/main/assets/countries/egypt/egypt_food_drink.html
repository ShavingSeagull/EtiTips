                    Egypt is a nation that has a surprising presence in the culinary world. It isn't uncommon, for example, to find an Egyptian restaurant in 
                    places like London, UK or Berlin, Germany. Some foods that are now enjoyed in the West, such as falafels, supposedly originated from Egypt, too. 
                    It is worth noting that Egyptian cuisine has always centred more around vegetables than meat, making it an ideal choice for vegetarians.

                    The signature dishes are Kushari (rice, lentils &amp; macaroni) and Kabab wa kofta (lamb or veal kebab with bread and salad).

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: 10% of the bill</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping is so important to Egyptians that it has its own word which you'll hear a lot - Backsheesh. Backsheesh can cover tips as well 
                    as bribes and or everyday Egyptians, the line can sometimes be hard to traverse! For a tourist, however, you'll find little issue if you 
                    follow our advice. For restaurants (and any service you encounter, if you're unsure of the specific amount), it is customary to tip 10% of the bill. 
                    Of course, if the service was fantastic or the venue upper class, a little more wouldn't go amiss.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note, that a lot of restaurants will include a service charge on the bill. However, this charge almost always goes to the restaurant and not the 
                    wait staff, so be sure to add 10% on top for the waiters, too! People don't earn well in Egypt at all these days and waiters really do rely on their 
                    tips to help make a living. Be sure to include it unless the service was terrible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An interesting tid-bit about all tipping (backsheesh) in Egypt: don't be surprised or die of shock if the person serving you complains that you haven't 
                    left enough. This is a common part of the backsheesh culture and should be handled in one of two ways - you can either take your tip back altogether or 
                    you can smile, say "It's enough" and walk away. We recommend the latter. Also, don't be surprised if people who haven't even provided a service ask for 
                    backsheesh. Naturally, anybody who hasn't provided a service should be ignored. It can be a little overwhelming at times, but stick to your guns and be 
                    prepared. By reading this, you've got the latter covered already!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is there a correct way to give the tip? In short, yes. If you are a man handing a man a tip, it is best to fold the note in your hand and give it to him 
                    in a motion like a handshake, while thanking him for the service. This is the nature of the backsheesh culture and how it is handled in Egypt, so it's best 
                    to go with it. Note, if you are a woman handing a man a tip or a man handing a woman a tip, you should limit your physical contact. Handing the notes over 
                    without the ceremony of the handshake would be appropriate. Be aware also, that you will likely find your server refusing to take the tip a couple of times. 
                    This is common and it is good manners to insist that they do. They will usually relent after a couple of attempts.

					<strong>- Generally acceptable rate: E£1-E£2 per drink or 10% of bill</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though Egypt is a Muslim country, bars do actually exist, though they are required to be indoors with their windows blocked from the public being 
                    able to see in from the outside. Tipping in bars is similar to restaurants, with 10% of the bill being appropriate.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As with all other services in Egypt, the generally acceptable tipping rate is 10% for cafés, too. This should apply whether you received table service 
                    or not. Again, don't make the act of tipping obvious - giving thanks for the service while discreetly passing the notes is the way to go.

                    When toasting in Egypt, the word to use is "في صحتكم!" (pronounced 'fee se-hat-ek'). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                <p>
                    Splitting the bill doesn't follow set rules in Egypt. It is common to see people paying for what they ordered, though it really depends on the group who are eating. 
                    It is fairly common, too, to pay for the entire meal if you invite somebody to dinner who you don't see often or haven't seen for a while. Likewise, they will 
                    probably do the same for you, so don't be surprised to find yourself in a fight to pay the bill. It is better to relent and treat them next time.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table. The following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Egypt, either in 
                    their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to take your shoes off before entering</li>
                    <li>If eating in a restaurant, it is rude to look at another person's plate. Conversely, if eating in somebody's home, it is perfectly acceptable (as you'll be eating the same thing)</li>
                    <li>
                        Egyptians commonly share some of the food on their plate. There is a ceremony to this, however. They (or you) will offer, it will be refused a couple of times, then 
                        it will accepted after around the third insistence. Don't make the mistake of withdrawing the offer after hearing a refusal once or twice; also, don't make the mistake 
                        of failing to offer in the first place or genuinely refusing their offer!
                    </li>
                    <li>The right hand is king in Egypt. You must eat your food with the right hand only. The left may be used for cutting something, for example, but use it sparingly</li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure to leave a little bit of food on your plate when you are finished, even if you're hungry! To clear your plate denotes that the host didn't feed you enough and 
                        will be taken very personally. Naturally, this doesn't apply in restaurants
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Following on from the point above, if second helpings are available, taking some would be a huge compliment to the host, as it shows their cooking is enjoyable. Just be sure 
                        to leave a little bit on the plate when you're done
                    </li>
                    <li>If eating at somebody's home, don't add salt to your food, as it is seen as an insult to the host's cooking</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If eating in somebody's home, it is very good practice to bring a gift. Either chocolates, sweets or pastries work well. Don't bring flowers, as these are linked to weddings 
                        or illness. You can make an exception if you know the hostess likes a particular flower, but otherwise it's best to avoid them altogether. Make sure you give the gift with the 
                        right hand, or both if it's heavy
                    </li>
                    <li>Be sure to compliment your host on their home, as this will be a great source of pride for the lady of the house</li>
                    <li>Don't expect easy access to alcohol as Egypt is a Muslim country. If you are offered alcohol, be sure not to drink to excess!</li>
                    <li>Egyptians will generally forgive etiquette mistakes by foreigners, so don't panic about any dinner dates you may have!</li>
