                    The country of the Renaissance, passion and the world's most famous empire, Italy is truly one of the most exquisite 
                    places on Earth. Whether you are a lover of art, philosophy, wine or history, you'll find something to float your boat here. 
                    While having fallen under harder times in recent years, Italy remains one of the bastions of Europe; showcasing the very best 
                    of European culture, history and lifestyle.

                    Greetings are a big thing in Italy. Whether meeting someone for the first time or the hundreth, you are expected to greet them 
                    when you meet and give a farewell when you part ways. Typically, this will be by using <i>Buongiorno/Buona sera</i> (good day/good evening), 
                    said both as the greeting and the farewell. The word <i>Ciao</i> is known and used throughout the world, but you shouldn't use this with 
                    strangers! <i>Ciao</i> is much more informal and used only for familiar faces. Also, note that when friends greet each other (when one or 
                    both are female), it is common to exchange a kiss on either cheek, starting with the left. For less-known acquaintances, a firm hand shake 
                    is the way to go.

                    One of the most common misconceptions for foreign tourists is that all Italians are rather hot-headed by nature. This impression is certainly 
                    understandable if you watch two Italians engage in conversation, but it isn't actually true at all. Italians are known for their fiery passion in 
                    all avenues of life, including the way they speak to each other. If a local believes you are wrong, they will tell you so and many a 
                    gentle chat have evolved into a heated debate this way. If you want to fit in with the local social life, however, you are going to have to 
                    inject a little more oomph into your social behaviour. This would be especially true of someone from the UK, for example, where the majority of 
                    native people are rather reserved by nature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No section on Italian social behaviour would be complete without mentioning the hand gestures! Italians are famed for their 
                    passionate gesticulations and to find someone who doesn't speak with their hands here would be very rare indeed. While not a 
                    requirement to fit in with Italian social life, it certainly wouldn't hurt to let your hands loose for a little conversing of their 
                    own!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, a word on English speaking: in hotels and cities, you are likely to find someone who at least speaks a little of the world's lingua franca, but 
                    don't expect to be understood by a huge number of people. This is especially true the further outside of cities you travel. Fortunately, while 
                    speaking English can be a little difficult in Italy, using your hands and big gestures can actually make you understood most of the time. So, as 
                    mentioned above, don't be afraid to let your hands do a little talking of their own if you need to be understood!

                    Italy, along with France, is the joint-most famous country on planet Earth for romance. Many a woman has swooned at the thought of 
                    a Casanova sweeping her off her feet whilst whispering their sweet nothings and many a man has dreamed of meeting a voluptuous 
                    Latin brunette. Is there any truth to the stereotype, however? In short, yes. Though, with all the unwritten rules, the dating etiquette 
                    in Italy isn't as straight forward as you may think...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dress to impress! Italy is home to some of the world's most prestigious fashion houses for a reason. More on the general dress sense 
                    in the Culture tab, but needless to say, first impressions count for everything in Italy and this goes for the dating scene, too. So, 
                    no turning up in a hoody and trainers! Whatever you decide to wear, make sure it's fashionable, fresh pressed and imaculate. You will 
                    absolutely be judged on your appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't be surprised if your date is ten minutes late! Virtually everyone is late for everything all the time in Italy, so arriving 
                    'fashionably late' is just...well...fashionably on time. Twenty minutes is even acceptable given a valid reason (such as horrendous traffic), 
                    though any longer than that and you can kiss the prospect of a second date goodbye. So, if you're a stickler for time keeping, you may 
                    have to grit your teeth and bear it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    A final note: if your date offers to pick you up or drop you home on the first date, they aren't automatically a lecher. The public transport system 
                    is notoriously unreliable and so it is often easier just to be picked up and travel to your date location together. Similarly, they won't 
                    necessarily be expecting to be invited inside when dropping you home, either. Though, for obvious reasons, that shouldn't be taken as gospel...
