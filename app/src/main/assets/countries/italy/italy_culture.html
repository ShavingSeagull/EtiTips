                    Italian culture is dominated by history, art, food, drink and passion. When one thinks of a rich cultural European nation, Italy 
                    is one of the first places to come to mind for most people, along with perhaps France or Spain and that's for good reason: home 
                    to some of the world's greatest minds and historical figures, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo and Julius Caesar, Italy has 
                    contributed more to human history and development than many other nations combined.

                    The official language is Italian and the national religion is Christianity.

                <p>
                    Italy is majority Christian, with a massive 78% of the population identifying with the Roman Catholic branch of the faith and 2% with 
                    other branches (as of 2018). The second highest affiliation is non-religious, coming in at only 15% of the populace, showing that, unlike 
                    much of the rest of western Europe, the younger generations are not moving away from religious affiliations, although many hold an identity 
                    without actively practicing.

                <p>
                    While technically a state of its own, Vatican City is located inside Rome and provides the home of the Catholic branch of Christianity for the 
                    entire world. Many Italians, as with most other things, can prove to be very passionate about their religion, so it would be wise to keep an err 
                    of decorum when discussing the subject. It would be ill advised to chastise Christianity in front of Italians, who would be very likely to tell 
                    you in no uncertain terms why you are wrong.

				<h3 class="section-header">Dress</h3>
				<p>
                    If you intend to go to Italy, you better pack your best! Appearance is paramount in the land of Gucci, Armani and Prada and you will absolutely be 
                    judged on the way you look. That may prove irksome to some, but it stems from good intentions - Italians wish to look immaculate, whether attending 
                    a wedding, walking the dog or popping to the shops. It is never too bothersome to look one's best in Italy, so if you wish to blend in and not draw 
                    stares, perhaps leave the tank tops and sandals at home...
                </p>
                <p>
                    An area where dress is even more scutinised is in churches. There is absolutely a set of rules to adhere to, whether you follow the faith or not. 
                    Italy's cornucopia of cathedrals and basilicas prove to be tourist hotspots for the god-fearing and otherwise, but they are still places of worship. 
                    So, to be able to enjoy those sites and not be thrown out in disgrace, you must follow these simple rules for dressing in the houses of God:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>
                        Ladies must cover their shoulders at all times. A scarf can be enough to achieve this and will also have the added benefit of covering any cleavage 
                        exposed by a low-cut top, which is also obviously a no-go.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Both men and women must cover their knees. For women, a long skirt that covers the knees is fine; a shorter skirt would require tights or leggings.
                        For the gents, if you wish to visit these sacred sites in shorts, you're going to have to switch to trousers or jeans. There will be no exceptions.
                    </li>
                    <li>Shoes must be worn inside the churches, though sandals are fine for both men and women. The rest of Rome might judge your fashion sense, though.</li>
                    <li>Hats should be removed when you enter the building.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3 class="section-header">Everyday Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Time keeping, time keeping, time keeping....is not a concern for the average Italian. Unlike other countries in Europe where time keeping is 
                    as sacred as life itself (looking at you, Germany), Italians much prefer to take their time. Whether hosting a dinner, meeting a date or doing 
                    something with friends, you can absolutely expect your Italian counterpart to arrive fasionably late, or, as it's called in Italy - on time. 
                    If you're visiting friends or especially if you're moving to Italy, it would pay dividends to cast off any notion of sticking to strict 
                    schedules. When in Rome, as they say...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elders used to be respected everywhere in Europe, but this has waned in recent years. In Italy, respect for your elders is still very present and 
                    not just in the Godfather movies! When dining with Italians, the elder will usually be the guest of honour and you will be expected to show them 
                    every courtesy. To set a good impression in Italy, always offer help to an older person who needs it, whether you know them or not. Picking up 
                    a dropped item or helping someone across a busy road are free, but can hold huge value in the moral code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with elders, family itself is a hugely important concept in Italian culture. It is common in the south to find extended family living under one 
                    roof, though this is waning a little in modern times. If you have an acquaintance in their late twenties, don't be surprised to hear they still live 
                    with their family - flying the nest isn't a huge ambition and even when it does happen, the nest flyer will still be expected to live close to their 
                    family. Needless to say, to think of asking an Italian to do something against their family's wishes is probably very unwise indeed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <h3 class="section-header">Work Life</h3>
                <p>
                    Italian businesses operate according to a traditional hierarchical structure, with little to no mingling between the differing levels of that hierarchy. 
                    This is in contrast to neighbours such as France, where egalitarianism reigns free. We may have said that time keeping is a foreign concept in Italy 
                    previously, but if you're scheduled to arrive to a meeting at 9am, you better be damn sure you arrive at 9am! Meetings and appointments may run late for 
                    various reasons, but the usual 'arrive 10 minutes late as standard' mantra should never be applied to work life in Italy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have business in Italy or with an Italian company, it would be wise to avoid scheduling that business in August, as this is when most companies 
                    take a vacation. If it's unavoidable, it's unavoidable, but do try to keep the month of August in mind when dealing with an Italian cohort.
