                    Italy has a decent public transport network that has improved its reputation in recent years. The local trains, once chastised 
                    for their poor time keeping (how typically Italian!), are now held in higher regard following a splurge in infrastructure investment. 
                    The national high-speed trains are an ideal way to get from city to city and prove not to be overly expensive. Large cities, such as 
                    Rome, Milan, Turin and Naples also boast a metro system, which can be useful in avoiding the horrendous traffic!

                <p>
                    As with much of the rest of Italy, tipping taxi drivers is by no means an expected custom. It is, however, rather common to see people 
                    rounding up the bill to the next Euro, but this is for matters of convenience in avoiding pockets of loose change rather than to 
                    provide a kind gesture to the driver. If you feel the need to give something, a Euro or two will definitely suffice. If you have 
                    booked a taxi on a pre-paid schedule (such as for picking you up from the airport and taking you to the hotel), you should give 
                    nothing extra, unless the driver helps you with your luggage.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Like the rest of the country, people are generally well behaved on public transport in Italy. Taking phone
                    calls is permitted on transport, but it is best to keep your voice down as much as you can; if you find people glaring at you, you have 
                    probably been too loud. Contrary to the stereotype, most Italians aren't overly loud and won't appreciate it if you are, either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to offer your seat to vulnerable people, such as the elderly or disabled, especially if they are women (and you are a man). 
                    Trains and the metro can get crowded during peak hours, so seating will be at a premium. Do the right thing and give a helping hand 
                    to those in need. You are representing your country when you go abroad, so making the effort to act courteously will leave a positive 
                    impression on the locals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While it is fairly accepted to take your shoes off on the trains, don't under any circumstance put your feet (shoed or not) on the seat 
                    opposite. This is seen as dirty and extremely rude.
                </p>
