                    Italy is hugely famed for its cuisine, with Italian cafés and restaurants present in most countries in the Western world. 
                    Whether it's pasta, bolognese or lasagna, it isn't a stretch to claim that 99% of people reading this have eaten an Italian 
                    inspired meal at one point in their lives, if not on regular occurances. Wine is, of course, the other famed aspect of Italian 
                    cuisine that, again, many people enjoy on occasion.

                    The signature dishes are Pasta (in any form) and Pizza.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tipping in Italian restaurants is an acceptable practice, but not actually essential and this is for two reasons. Firstly, waiters 
                    in Italy are paid an acceptable wage for the job they do - they don't rely on tips to make a living. Secondly, the tip and/or service 
                    charge are usually included in the bill. Most establishments will include a cover charge if you take a seat at a table (always drink your 
                    beverage standing up in cafés/bars!), while most will also include a service charge (as indicated by the word servizio on the bill). You are 
                    welcome to leave a little something extra if you wish, but know that it will be on top of extra charges.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, if you happened to be served by the owner of an establishment, do not tip! Leaving a tip is seen as a power dynamic, which is why 
                    it is acceptableto tip an employee, but not the owner.

                    Tipping in typical pubs and bars in Italy isn't really expected. You can always round up the bill or leave a Euro or two if you wish, 
                    but it isn't an expected custom. If you are receiving table service, giving a little something would be a nice gesture. Not mandatory 
                    by any means, but a Euro or two wouldn't go amiss.

                    <strong>- Generally acceptable rate: Round up to the next Euro</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though the tipping culture in Italy is quite absent, it does exist to some extent in cafés. Whether just having a coffee or a small 
                    bite to eat, it is common practice to round up the bill to the next Euro. So, for a bill of €4.70, you would pay €5, leaving a tip of 30c. 
                    This may seem in stark contrast to some cultures, but owing to the reasons listed above in the restaurant section, tipping isn't 
                    hugely necessary for the staff here, though will never be turned down.

                    When toasting in Italy, the word to use is "Saluti!" (pronounced sa-lootee). If clinking glasses, you should always look at the other person, not at your glass!

                    It is fairly typical in Italy that the person who invited the other will pay the entire bill; however, it is polite to offer to pay, even if you are the guest. 
                    Italians have nothing against splitting a bill, but there is a certain way of doing it. Most restaurants will try to dissuade you from paying with multiple 
                    credit cards because they have to pay a fee for each one, so if splitting the bill and paying by card, it is common practice for one person to pay the entire 
                    bill with their card and everyone else reimburse them with cash. Most receipts in restaurants also aren't very itemised, so be prepared to split the bill evenly 
                    with your party.

                    Perhaps unsurprisingly for a nation famed for its cuisine, there is a general standard expected at the dinner table. General household standards may have eased 
                    a bit over time, though the following are the key aspects you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in France, either in their homes or in public 
                    establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>You <b>have</b> to ask for your bill in a restaurant! Waiters will never urge you to leave unless it is past closing time</li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, wait for the most important person to pick up their cutlery before you do. This will either be the host or the oldest person at the table</li>
                    <li>If eating in a restaurant, it is acceptable to start eating as soon as your food arrives</li>
                    <li>The host will always sit in the middle of the table, not at the head as in a lot of other cultures</li>
                    <li>Keep your hands on/above the table at all times, not just when eating. No elbows, though!</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't</strong> pass gas in any form while at the table</li>
                    <li>Chew with your mouth closed. Perhaps a bit obvious, but this isn't actually important in some cultures</li>
                    <li>Use your cultery properly. Knife in your dominant hand and fork in the other, whether you need your knife or not</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course. The caveat to this is the three-pronged fork, which is only used 
                        for eating fish. You will also receive a knife that resembles a butter knife. This is for skinning the fish and <b>NOT</b> for 
                        cutting the flesh. You must use your fork to do that
                    </li>
                    <li>Be prepared to take your time! Eating in Italy is almost ceremonial and nobody likes to rush the experience</li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is good practice to bring a gift. Either chocolates, wine or flowers (not red roses) work well</li>
                    <li>Leave your bread to the left of your dinner plate, never on top of it</li>
                    <li>Don't use a spoon while eating pasta (likely spaghetti). Use the side of the bowl to twirl it around your fork</li>
                    <li>
                        Arrive a few minutes late if eating at somebody's home! Everything runs late in Italy, so if you arrive on time, your host will likely
                        still be preparing the food and you will be inconveniencing them
                    </li>
                    <li>A host will always keep your wine glass topped up and it is considered rude to refuse more. If you don't wish for any more, keep your glass full</li>
