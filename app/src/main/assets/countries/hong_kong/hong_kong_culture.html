                    Aside from the ancient history Hongkongers share with their mainland Chinese counterparts, the modern-day city is centred around business, education and 
                    prosperity. Many Hongkongers are educated to a high level and most have attended a Western school at some point. While the day-to-day culture shares obvious 
                    similarities to mainland China for the most part, Hong Kong is unique in that it also has a strong blend of Western culture and values ingrained from its time 
                    as a British colony.

                    The main language is Cantonese and the major faith is Chinese Folk Religion.

                <p>
                    Though the major religion is technically the traditional Chinese Folk Religion, the vast majority of Hongkongers officially 
                    identify as irreligious; the Chinese governing state is also fiercly atheist. It tends to be the case that the native people hold an affiliation to the traditional faith without recognising 
                    it in a formal format, such as on a census. Buddhism is also present in a fairly large capacity in Hong Kong and mainland China and it isn't uncommon to find people 
                    practising the local folk religion and Buddhism side-by-side. Despite Western influence over many years, Christianity remains a minority religion in Hong Kong.

                    Conducting yourself well in Hong Kong society with regards to religion is certainly easier than some other countries, owing to the largely irreligious population. Whether you believe in something 
                    or not, few people will take much notice here. That said, it would be wise not to try and push your beliefs on the local people, as this would come across as very rude.

                    The general dress sense in Hong Kong outside of festival times is fairly Westernised, though not as much as one might think given Hong Kong's colonial past. The people like 
                    to maintain a smart appearance, especially when going out for dinner etc. Appearance is part of the 'Face' system used in Chinese and Hongkonger society, so making sure you always look 
                    respectable will go a long way to having others hold you in higher regard, too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Business dress is dark and conservative. The key is to try and blend in with your co-workers, so nothing flashy, which includes 
                    an abundance of jewellery. Dark suits are definitely the way to go and make sure it fits you well. Ladies should also adhere to a 
                    conservative dress sense, with pant suits being a good choice.

                    In Hong Kong, family is everything. There are many countries that follow this approach, with much of the Middle East and the Latin countries of 
                    Europe and South America also placing huge importance on the family unit. Folks from the West would likely describe the typical Hongkonger family unit 
                    as 'traditional', though all this means in reality is that they operate the same way Western families did a few decades ago. In practice, this means 
                    the father will go out to work hard to provide for his family, while the mother will maintain the house and raise the children. It is sometimes the case 
                    that the mothers will have to work, too, though it is the desire of every local man to be in a position where he can provide for his family alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also a part of the family unit are elders, who will typically live with their families. In fact, it's normal to see three generations living under one roof in 
                    Hong Kong! Elders are hugely, hugely respected here and it is <b>never</b> a good idea to do or say anything that would cause offence or embarrassment for an older 
                    person. They start eating first, they enter rooms first and they take pole position at any important event, bar a wedding of course. If you are in a 
                    relationship with a local and wish to make a good impression on their families, do everything you can to show respect to the elders. Actions speak louder than 
                    words, especially in Oriental cultures, so don't let the language barrier stop you.

                    Anybody who has tuned into the news at any point since 1949 will be aware of the communist revolution that swept China. However, because Hong Kong is a mostly autonomous 
                    society (for now - this has an expiration date), the forms of government do not match and this forms the basis of much contention in Hong Kong. The locals here are generally 
                    fiercly democratic and fear the day when Chinese communist rule will come into full effect. Hongkongers and the authoritarian Chinese state have come to loggerheads on more than 
                    one occasion and it is imperitive that you don't broach this subject in Hong Kong when you visit. Naturally, there are communist loyalists here as well, so it really would be wise, 
                    especially as a foreigner, to just stay out of the argument.

                    Hong Kong is THE city of business, but doing business here involves strict protocol that you will absolutely need to adhere to in order to be successful. Luckily, we will cover all the major areas of business 
                    etiquette here, so have no fear!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's start at the beginning - entering the meeting room. Yes, there is even protocol for that. Business in Hong Kong is strictly hierarchical, meaning the senior ranking employee 
                    has the most authority. This translates into physicality, too, in the sense that when your local counterparts enter the room, they will do so in order of seniority - the head 
                    of the delgation will enter first, followed by his number two etc. It is important for you to follow suit and do the same, as this shows them exactly who the one in charge is; also follow 
                    this protocol when leaving the room and always allow your counterparts to leave first. Next we have greetings. Sometimes, especially when dealing with very senior employees, a small bow will 
                    be necessary, though these days the common handshake is becoming the preferred choice. Remember to keep the handshake fairly light, as a crushing grip implies aggression. Always let your Hongkonger 
                    counterpart initiate the handshake, however! Following the greeting will likely be the exchange of business cards, which still have great importance in Oriental countries. You should always accept 
                    the card with two hands and be sure to study it for a moment. As for your own cards, it would be wise and considered polite to have special ones printed in Cantonese on one side and English on the other. In 
                    regards of design, gold is the colour of prestige and wealth, so consider having your Hong Kong business cards printed with some gold on them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meetings will always start with some small-talk and this is actually considered an important part of the process, so be sure to engage in it. The locals like to do business with people they 
                    have some knowledge of, hence why they like to try and get a glimpse of your personality beforehand. Good topics to discuss are family, interests, the weather and interesting locations. You 
                    will set a good impression if you comment positively on things you have experienced while in Hong Kong - either places, food or festival events will work well. On the contrary, there are some topics 
                    which should <b>never</b> be brought up and these are political tensions with China, the opinion of British colonial rule versus being under Chinese rule and communism in general. All of these areas are very 
                    sensitive subjects in Hong Kong, so if you wish for your meeting to go well, just steer clear of them altogether.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we mentioned on the Social tab, Hongkongers like to maintain an air of calm in all situations, so it's best not to show too much emotion during a meeting, either positive or negative. Don't worry, 
                    smiling is allowed, but hold back from getting too passionate about your proposal or becoming agitated if things aren't going the way you would like. Partnered with this is the Chinese/Hongkonger system of 'Face' 
                    we have mentioned numerous times already. Pay very close attention: do not, under any circumstance, say anything that would cause your counterpart, or anyone in the room for that matter, to lose 'face'. 
                    We can't stress this enough. This also includes saying "no", which shows a flat-out refusal for something they have suggested, thus resulting in them losing 'face' with their colleagues. If you wish to 
                    disagree - and your local counterparts will do the same, too - use phrases such as "Please allow me more time to think about that" or "That may be possible". This is equivalent to when we say "Maybe" 
                    in English, but actually mean no. Do bear in mind as well, that if your counterpart says something along those lines to you, the answer is actually no. Likewise, if they say "That won't be a big problem", 
                    you can safely assume that it is a huge problem. Always, always keep the concept of maintaining 'face' in mind, both for your side of the negotiation and theirs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Time keeping is an important concept in Hong Kong, so do be sure to arrive when you are supposed to. It would also be a wise idea to schedule an interpreter to be present, though many locals do speak English. It's best not 
                    to give anything as important as a business negotiation the chance to fail due to something being lost in translation or misinterpreted. Take note of where you are when arranging an interpreter - unlike in mainland China, Cantonese 
                    will be the language you'll need here. As for gift giving, that's easy - don't. Most times this is seen as bribery, so it's best avoided altogether, <b>especially</b> if you're dealing with anybody from the government.
