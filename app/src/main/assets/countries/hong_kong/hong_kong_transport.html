                    Hong Kong has an excellent public transport network, with bus, rail, tram and ferry being options. The city cites rail as its 
                    transport backbone and as such, it offers an impressive service via the MTR (mass transit railway) and light rail/tram options. 
                    There are some buses that go cross-border into mainland China and ferries that connect the separated parts of Hong Kong.

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with most other services in the country, tipping is not required in Hong Kong. In fact, what usually happens here is that the 
                    driver will round-up the cost of the fair to the nearest dollar anyway, thus providing himself a tip and not burdening you with 
                    pockets of useless change. So, in a way you have already tipped the driver, thus you're certainly not required to give extra!

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour on Hong Kong public transport are decent enough, with the typical daily behaviour of people reflected when they 
                    use transport, too. Be wary of very busy buses in big cities as pickpockets aren't unheard of, though they're not a huge problem either. 
                    If you want to avoid working up a sweat (or indulging in the odour of others who do), you'll be pleased to hear that most trains and stations 
                    are air conditioned. Note the use of the word 'most' though - better apply the deodorant just in case!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to give up your seat to somebody vulnerable, such as the elderly or the disabled. Given how respected elders are in Hongkonger society, 
                    you will be setting a massively positive example by doing so. Remember that you are representing your country when you go abroad, so be sure to 
                    conduct yourself properly, as it will not only make your time in Hong Kong easier, but also those who follow you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bonus non-etiquette tip! Hong Kong uses the Octopus Card, which is a contactless top-up card that you can use to pay for all public transport. 
                    Unlike other smart cards of the same nature, the Octopus Card can also be used at parking metres as well as in fast-food restauarants, convenience 
                    stores, supermarkets and even most vending machines! A card can be purchased from any station; make sure you pick one up if you plan on staying in 
                    Hong Kong for more than a few days.
