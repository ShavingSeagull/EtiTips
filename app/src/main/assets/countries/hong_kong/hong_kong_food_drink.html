                    Hong Kong/Chinese cuisine is one of the most famous in the world, with its various dishes and delicacies being a favourite in virtually every Western country, as well as others 
                    further afield. Known for its flavour and moreishness, the range of dishes has grown to incorporate some neighbouring delicacies, such as those from Singapore, 
                    Thailand and Vietnam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The signature dishes are Dim Sum (small steamed portions of various food) and Gu Lo Yuk (sweet and sour pork)

                <h3 class="section-header">Tipping</h3>
                <p>
                    The general rule in Hong Kong is that you don't tip for most things. Many establishments will refuse a tip and a lot of them will add a service charge anyway. The one major 
                    exception, as is the case in mainland China as well, is a tour guide. For any tours that aren't private, a tip of around HK$10 - HK$70 per person will suffice.
                </p>

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, no tipping is expected in restaurants and many will refuse the offer outright. Quite a few establishments may include a 10-15% service charge, 
                    so be aware of that if dining in such a venue. Take note, however, that whether a service charge has been included or not, a tip doesn't have to be left. If you <i>do</i> 
                    decide to try and leave something, do so in cash, as a tip left via card will likely just go to the restaurant and not the server - you've paid enough for your food, there 
                    is no need to pay extra!

					<strong>- No tipping expected</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As with restaurants above and most other services in Hong Kong, no tip is expected at all, though many establishments will have a tip jar on the counter. 
                    You're not expected to use it.

                    As with restaurants and bars above, as well as most other services in Hong Kong, no tip is expected at all though, again, there will likely be a tip jar. 
                    Once again, there is no expectation to use it.

                <p>
                    When toasting in Hong Kong, the word to use is "飲杯!" (pronounced "Yam-boy!"). If clinking glasses with someone of higher authority than you, it is polite 
                    to touch the rim of your glass to a part of their glass that is lower than the rim, to symbolise you acknowledge that they are above you. If they are very senior 
                    or you wish to convey the ultimate respect, touch the rim of your glass to the bottom of theirs.

                <p>
                    Hongkongers have a rather set cultural precedent for paying for guests. When you're in Hong Kong on holiday, you are a guest and so any 
                    local friends you may have will likely pay for dinner along with a lot of other things. It is considered rude to attempt to pay for yourself 
                    after it has been established that your local friend will pay the entire bill - simply thank them for the meal and comment on how 
                    delicious it was. Likewise, however, if you end up hosting any Hongkonger friends in your country, they will expect you to pay for nearly 
                    everything as well!
                </p>
                <p>
                    If nobody has offered to pay the bill before the evening begins, expect a wrestling session to break out when the bill arrives. The concept of 'face' 
                    dictates that every man at the table should try to pay the bill, though obviously many will hold silent reservations in their minds. If you really want to 
                    pay, keep the bill and say things such as "Allow me the honour" or "You can get the next one". If you would rather not pay, still offer, but give up after 
                    insisting once or twice. Be aware that it may backfire and you could end up saddled with the bill!

                    There is a general standard expected at the dinner table, although depending on where you are eating, this could be a bit
                    more relaxed or a bit stricter. General household standards have eased over time, though the following are the key aspects
                    you should be keeping in mind when eating around others in Hong Kong, either in their homes or in public establishments:
                </p>
                <ul class="general-etiquette-list" style="padding-right: 10px;">
                    <li>Remember to take off your shoes when entering somebody's house!</li>
                    <li>Dishes are served in large communal bowls or plates that everybody takes from</li>
                    <li>Seniority dictates who starts the meal off and this is usually the eldest person at the table. Never begin eating until the guest of honour has started.</li>
                    <li>
                        Hong Kong largely uses chopsticks (though many restaurants will stock western cutlery, too), but there is an etiquette to handling them. Never leave them 
                        pointing up in a bowl of food as this is a custom involved with funerals. When talking at the dinner table, it is good practice to place your chopsticks 
                        on the chopstick stand next to your plate. Don't use them to point while you're talking
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unlike in the West, where bringing your crockery to your mouth is extremely bad manners, in Hong Kong it is expected for smaller bowls, such as rice bowls. 
                        It can greatly aid in not spilling food, especially when using chopsticks
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Slurping when eating noodles or soup isn't considered bad manners at all; in fact, it shows you are enjoying the food! Again, bringing the bowl to your mouth as 
                        you eat will be the usual practice
                    </li>
                    <li>Small burps while eating is actually a sign of appreciation for the food. This is in stark contrast to most other countries</li>
                    <li>Don't eat directly from communal plates. Use the serving spoon or utensil provided to place some of the food onto your plate</li>
                    <li>Likewise, don't take the last portion from the communal dish unless it is offered to you</li>
                    <li>The faster you finish your food, the faster your plate will be refilled. If you are full, it is best to leave a little food to show you can't eat anymore</li>
                    <li>
                        If eating at an upper class establishment with multiple sets of western cutlery and multiple courses of meals, start from the
                        outside set and work your way in with each passing course.
                    </li>
                    <li>If eating in somebody's home, it is polite to wait to be seated. They will likely have a seating plan in mind, which will involve the elders being in the most prominent place</li>
                    <li>
                        It is good manners to bring a small gift if eating at somebody's home. Special expensive teas or a good quality liquor work well. If you wrap the gift, it's best to do so in red and/or gold paper, 
                        as these are the colours of prosperity and many other colours are associated with negative things
                    </li>

                        Take note of the local dining etiquette, especially if you are Western - the differences between Eastern and Western dining 
                        practices can be quite vast sometimes
