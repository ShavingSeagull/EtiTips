                    Hong Kong, while not technically a sovereign nation (it's a territory of China), behaves with autonomy and has become one of the global financial hubs of the World. Famed 
                    for being a colony of the United Kingdom from 1842-1997 and holding good relations with the UK to this day, Hong Kong has become synonymous with wealth, prosperity and 
                    global trade. The city has its own currency, its own laws and drives on the opposite side of the road to China.

					The administrative centre is Tamar and the currency is the Hong Kong Dollar ($ or HK$).

				<p>
                    For many Westerners, Hong Kong's societal attitude would be viewed as 'traditional' in the sense that the West used to hold similar values which have sinced changed. One of 
                    these concepts is that of 'honour', but since the word is more synonymous with Japan, we'll instead change it to 'respect'. Hongkonger behaviour is dictated, 
                    at least in part, by this concept of respect and not losing face, so to speak. It is for this reason that it is very unlikely for a local to do or say something 
                    that would make you look foolish or unfavoured in public. Likewise, you should do the same! To discredit someone in public in Hong Kong would be a major faux-pas and 
                    highly disrespectful. This goes hand-in-hand with remaining calm in almost any situation, another concept Hongkongers have mastered over their many years of societal 
                    existence. Not speaking loudly is a branch of this attitude, as is the distaste toward bodily contact during conversation. While the locals may stand quite close to you 
                    when conversing, you should never touch them, such as a pat on the back etc. Hands to yourself at all times and keep the vocal decibels low!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The concept of social grace tends to vastly differ in China compared to the West, but owing to Hong Kong's long history with the UK and its presence as a global financial hub, 
                    these differences are less pronounced in Hong Kong compared to mainland China. It should still be kept in mind, however, that the locals are of an Oriental culture and as such, 
                    social behaviour in certain scenarios is likely to be different to what you may be used to outside of the Orient. An example of this would be someone speaking very freely about an 
                    obvious change in your appearance, such as gaining or losing weight. For a lot of Westerners, such things would be highly rude to comment on, but in Chinese based cultures the 
                    nature of direct speaking tends to allow it. Definitely something to keep in mind. Unlike China, you won't experience the fascination from the locals because you're foreign, however - 
                    the people here are well used to seeing and dealing with them due to Hong Kong's place in the financial world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of people assume that greetings in Hong Kong involve bowing, but this isn't really the case. The oriental concept of bowing exists far more in Japan than Chinese areas, so leading 
                    with a handshake and a smile is more appropriate. Do note, however, that a handshake in Hong Kong should be kept light and weaker than would be expected elsewhere in the world. 
                    It isn't just personal preference - a strong handshake here is perceived as aggressive, so it's best to follow the local protocol. One last side note to point out is that you shouldn't 
                    compare Hongkongers to mainland Chinese. Generally speaking, the locals are very proud of their long history with the UK and see themselves as set apart from the mainland Chinese, even 
                    though the UK seceded control of the area back to China in 1997. Forced Chinese integration is a very sensitive subject here.

                    A note on English speaking: in stark contrast to mainland China, where very few people speak English, most Hongkongers actually do. This is due to the long history of colonisation by the UK, 
                    as well as many locals being educated in Western schools. If you speak English, you'll likely be pleasantly surprised at how enthusiastic the locals are about speaking English with you. It 
                    tends to be a source of pride to be able to communicate via the World's de facto lingua franca here.

                    Dating in Hong Kong is a far more serious affair than in the West. People (women in particular) are under a lot of pressure to find a marriage partner before they reach a certain age. 
                    The family plays a much more involved role in relationships here, too, meaning that if the family disapproves of you, the relationship is likely doomed. General attitudes 
                    toward sex are more traditional, too, with many local men saying they would prefer a wife who hasn't engaged in premarital sex.

                <p>
                    As for couples coming to Hong Kong on holiday, the rules are pretty simple - keep those hands and lips where we can see them! Couples falling over each other at every given 
                    opportunity will not be looked on favourably whatsoever, so keep private moments to private places. A note has to be made for same-sex couples: homosexuality is legal in 
                    Hong Kong these days, but the attitude toward it is still very different from other parts of the World. It would be very wise indeed, even more so than for heterosexual couples, to keep all shows of 
                    affection confined to a private place. Generally speaking, however, things will be a little easier for same-sex couples here than in mainland China.

                <h3 class="section-header">Useful Words</h3>
                <p>
                        Below are some of the most common words (such as please and thank you) that can help you get by when visiting Hong Kong. Though China speaks Mandarin as its main language, Hong Kong speaks Cantonese. Mandarin 
                        will likely be understood here, but the locals aren't fond of the Chinese government's push to replace Cantonese with Mandarin. The words listed below will be in Cantonese. Learning a few could also help you make a good 
                        impression on the locals! Phonetic pronunciation is in parentheses ().

                    <li><b>早晨</b> (jo-sahn) - <i>Good morning</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>午安</b> (ng-on) - <i>Good afternoon</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>晚安</b> (maan-on) - <i>Good evening</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>唔該</b> (mm-goy) - <i>Thank you</i>. This is used when someone helps you or you receive a service.</li>
                    <li><b>多謝</b> (do-jeh) - <i>Thank you</i>. This is used when receiving a gift.</li>

                    <li><b>拜拜</b> (bye bye) - <i>Bye</i>. A lot of Hongkongers have adopted the English phrase "bye bye", so you can actually use that, too! Just make sure you say it twice instead of once, as we usually would in English.</li>
                    <li><b>係</b> (haai) - <i>Yes</i>.</li>
                    <li><b>唔係</b> (mm-haai) - <i>No</i>.</li>

                    <li><b>Sorry</b> (sorry) - <i>Yup, it's literally the English word 'sorry'. It's used a lot in Hong Kong.</i></li>
                    <li><b>唔該</b> (mm-goy) - <i>Excuse me</i>. Used when you want to pass by someone on the street.</li>
