                    The UK boasts an extensive public transport network. While some services (notably the trains) leave
                    something to be desired from time to time, visitors will find a connection to any city or major town
                    in the country from virtually anywhere. This is most true in London, which has rail connections
                    to every major city in the country.

                    Tipping, as with most other places, only applies to taxis. Most taxis are still cash based, making tipping a
                    continually expected part of the culture. Some companies, such as Uber, will employ a debit card based system
                    that includes pre-paying for your journey, making tipping virtually redundant. You could still give your driver
                    a few Pounds of course, but in such circumstances it will be less expected than if paying by cash.

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
                    Standards of behaviour aren't high on UK public transport systems. As the general level of social grace has
                    degraded with passing generations, it isn't uncommon to hear youths acting boistrously on trains and buses.
                    Such behaviour is abhorred by the general populace, however, so it would be best not to emulate it.
				</p>
				<p>
                    Buses and trains display signs notifying passengers to give up certain seats for elderly, pregnant or disabled
                    people, but for the reasons mentioned above, not everyone adheres to it. Generally speaking, however, even in
                    major cities like London, there will always be people willing to do the right thing and such behaviour is looked
                    at favourably by the native people. If you see an elderly person, pregnant woman or somebody with walking difficulties
                    board your bus or train, be sure to offer your seat if you are sitting near the door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Contrary to the passage above about boistrous behaviour, most British people prefer to act reservedly in public.
                    Most will speak in a whisper while on a busy bus or train and those who broadcast their phone calls to the entire
                    vehicle or, worse, play their music on speaker, will be met with side-glanced glares and quiet tuts. If you are
                    travelling around rush hour (17:00 - 19:00), bear in mind that folks just want to get home after a long day at work 
                    and would prefer to do so with as little disruption as possible. This is especially true in cities.
                </p>

                    Bonus tip! - If you are visiting London, you should be aware that the entire public transport system 
                    (buses, trains and the famous Tube subway network) use the Oyster Card: a pre-paid card that requires you to 'tap in'
                    when you board the vehicle or ticket gate and 'tap out' when you arrive at your destination. You can still buy train 
                    and Tube tickets, but you can't pay cash for buses, so it may be wise to pick up an Oyster Card. They are available 
                    for purchase at any underground (Tube) station. You can also top-up your card there, too.
