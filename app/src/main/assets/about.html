                    EtiTips is an app for aiding your travels abroad, by giving you helpful tips and
                    advice on etiquette in the areas of social behaviour, food and drink, general culture
                    and public transport. It can often be the case, for example, that when you are dining 
                    at a restaurant, the thought suddenly occurs that you're not sure if it is customary to 
                    tip the waiter in the country you're visiting or not. In some places it's expected, in 
                    others it's considered rude!
                    <br><br>
                    Luckily, EtiTips is at hand to save your blushes!

                <h3 class="about-paragraph-header">What if I don't have internet access abroad?</h3>
                <p>
                    No problem! Unlike most other apps on the market today, EtiTips doesn't require
                    internet access to function; it is an entirely offline app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We thought it would be silly to create a service that requires internet access when
                    you're abroad, seeing as it's not necessarily the case that you'll have access to the
                    net - WiFi can be spotty and data roaming charges can be painful! It would be a huge
                    disappointment to find yourself in need of a quick tip, only to discover you don't have
                    internet access. So, the decision to make EtiTips offline was made.
                </p>
                <h3 class="about-paragraph-header">I'm from country x and these tips aren't true!</h3>
                <p>
                    Please note that the advice given in EtiTips is intended for foreign visitors to your
                    country. You may take some of the things you see here for granted because you live
                    in the country you're reading about, but for a visitor it can be easy to make mistakes.
                    It is often the silly little things that can be missed, but is often those that can
                    have the most impact on the native population. The tips and advice in this app are
                    designed to give foreign visitors the best chance of conducting themselves in a way
                    that is both respectful and natural to the native people and culture.
                </p>
                <h3 class="about-paragraph-header">Are there plans to expand EtiTips?</h3>
                <p>
                    Certainly! The more countries we can feature, the more people are able to make
                    use of the service. There are also plans to add translations in other languages, as
                    this would make the benefits of EtiTips available to non-English speaking people, too.
                    We have plans for more features in the pipeline as well, so stay tuned.
                </p>
                <h3 class="about-paragraph-header">Is there an iOS version?</h3>
                <p>
                    Not at this time. It isn't in the plans to launch an iOS version of EtiTips, but this
                    could potentially change in the future.
                </p>
                <h3 class="about-paragraph-header">Ads are a pain. Can I get rid of them?</h3>
                <p>
                    We agree, they are. Unforunately, a lot of work goes into making a piece of software
                    and it's only fair that that work is compensated. We have tried to make the ads as
                    unobtrusive as possible - a small banner ad when you view a country and a full page
                    ad every now and then. Even so, if you wish to disable them, you can do so in the options
                    menu you found this page on, under the section titled 'Remove Ads'. A small one-time 
                    consideration will be charged to disable them for the lifetime of the app on your 
                    current device.
