					Comprised of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the United Kingdom is an island situated on the
					western cusp of Europe, just an hour's ferry ride from the continent. Perhaps best known for its long, rich history
					and internationally renowned monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. The UK has had a colourful history; at its peak, the
					British Empire covered two thirds of the globe.
				</p>
				<p>
					The capital city is London and the currency is the British Pound (Â£).

				<h3 class="section-header">Behaviour</h3>
				<p>
					The stereotype of the British 'stiff upper lip' has faded somewhat over time, but a certain way of conducting
					oneself is still expected in the UK, especially by the older population. British people generally find brashness
					and arrogance to be a turn-off, while a loud boisterous display will often be met with tuts by passers-by.
				</p>
				<p>
					To be well received in British society - especially outside the big cities - you should be polite, remember
					to say please and thank you, show courtesy to older people and keep an air of civility during times when you
					may be tempted to let it go.

				<hr class="line" style="width: 90px;" />
				<p>
					If you are travelling to the UK with your sweetheart, be mindful not to rub your relationship in everybody's
					faces. Overly overt public displays of affection are likely to be greeted with hushed comments of "Ugh, God".
				</p>
				<p>
					Same sex relationships and marriages are legal in the UK and are on the whole tolerated by the native population.
					If you are concerned about your sexuality when travelling abroad, you will have no fears in the UK. Large cities
					like London are home to entirely homosexual districts and the general mantra in such places is
					'You can be what you want as long as you don't hurt anybody'. That being said, do keep the previous section about
					public displays of affection in mind...
